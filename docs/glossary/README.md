# Glossary of Terms

This glossary defines key terms used within the `afz1` project documentation and code.

*   **Algorithmic Trading (Algo Trading):**  Trading using computer programs that automatically execute trades based on predefined rules and algorithms.

*   **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of rules and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate with each other. In `afz1`, APIs are used to access data from exchanges, AI models, and other services.

*   **Backtesting:**  Evaluating the historical performance of a trading strategy by simulating its trades on past market data.

*   **Drawdown:** The peak-to-trough decline during a specific period for an investment, strategy, or trading account. Often used as a risk metric.

*   **Funding Rate:**  Periodic payments exchanged between perpetual futures contract traders based on the difference between the perpetual contract price and the spot price. Used to keep perpetual contracts anchored to the spot market.

*   **Large Language Model (LLM):**  A type of artificial intelligence model trained on massive amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like text. Used in `afz1` for market analysis, sentiment analysis, and strategy development.

*   **Liquidation:**  The forced closing of a leveraged trading position by an exchange when the trader's margin falls below a required level.

*   **OHLCV Data:**  Market data consisting of Open, High, Low, Close prices, and Volume for a specific time period. Fundamental data for technical analysis.

*   **Open Interest:** The total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as options or futures, that have not been settled.  Indicates market participation and liquidity.

*   **PEP 8:**  Style guide for Python code, aiming to improve code readability and consistency.

*   **Prompt:**  Input text given to a Large Language Model to guide its response or generate desired output. In `afz1`, prompts are used to instruct AI models for specific tasks.

*   **Rate Limiting:**  A mechanism used by APIs to limit the number of requests a user can make within a given time period. Used to prevent API abuse and ensure fair access.

*   **Sharpe Ratio:**  A risk-adjusted return metric that measures excess return per unit of risk (volatility). Higher Sharpe Ratio generally indicates better risk-adjusted performance.

*   **Sentiment Analysis:**  The process of computationally determining the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in text data. Used in `afz1` to gauge market sentiment from social media and news.

*   **Strategy (Trading Strategy):**  A predefined set of rules and conditions that dictate when to buy, sell, or hold a trading asset. In `afz1`, strategies are implemented as Python classes.

*   **Token (Cryptocurrency Token):** A digital asset representing a unit of value or utility on a blockchain network.

*   **Volatility:**  The degree of variation of a trading price series over time, often measured by standard deviation or variance. Indicates market risk and price fluctuation.

*   **Virtual Environment:**  An isolated Python environment that allows you to install packages and dependencies for a specific project without affecting system-wide Python installations or other project environments. Recommended for managing project dependencies in `afz1`.

**(Add any other project-specific terms or acronyms that are important to define.)**
