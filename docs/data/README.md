# Data Guide

This guide documents the data sources, Market Data API, and data handling mechanisms within the `afz1` project.

## Data Sources Overview

The `afz1` project utilizes various data sources to provide comprehensive market information for agents and strategies. These sources include:

*   **Exchange APIs:** (List specific exchange APIs used, e.g., Binance API, Coinbase API, HyperLiquid API)
    *   Provides real-time and historical market data, including OHLCV data, order book information, and trade data.
*   **CoinGecko API:** [coingecko.com](https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentations/v3/)
    *   Used for cryptocurrency market data, token information, new listings, top gainers/losers, and more.
*   **Twitter API (or alternative social media APIs):** [developer.twitter.com](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api) (or links to alternative API docs)
    *   Provides access to social media data for sentiment analysis and trend monitoring.
*   **Sentiment Analysis Providers (If Applicable):** (List any specific sentiment analysis APIs or services used)
    *   Provides pre-calculated sentiment scores or data.
*   **(Potentially other data sources, e.g., news APIs, on-chain data providers):** (List any other data sources used)

## Market Data API (`src/agents/api.py`)

The `afz1` project includes a Market Data API (`src/agents/api.py`) to abstract data access and provide a consistent interface for agents to retrieve market information.

*   **API Endpoints and Methods:** (Document each API endpoint and method with details on functionality, request parameters, and response formats. Examples below)

    *   **`get_liquidation_data(exchange, symbol, timeframe)`:**
        *   **Purpose:** Retrieves liquidation data for a specific cryptocurrency pair on a given exchange.
        *   **Request Parameters:**
            *   `exchange` (string): Exchange name (e.g., "binance", "hyperliquid").
            *   `symbol` (string): Trading pair symbol (e.g., "BTC-USD", "ETH-USDT").
            *   `timeframe` (string): Data timeframe (e.g., "1h", "15m", "5m").
        *   **Response Format:** (Describe the JSON response structure, including fields like `timestamp`, `price`, `quantity`, `side`).
        *   **Example Usage (Python):**
            ```python
            from src.agents.api import MarketDataAPI
            api = MarketDataAPI()
            liquidation_data = api.get_liquidation_data(exchange="binance", symbol="BTC-USD", timeframe="1h")
            print(liquidation_data)
            ```

    *   **`get_funding_rate_data(exchange, symbol)`:**
        *   **(Document parameters, response, and example usage similar to `get_liquidation_data`)**

    *   **`get_open_interest_data(exchange, symbol, timeframe)`:**
        *   **(Document parameters, response, and example usage)**

    *   **`get_new_tokens_data(exchange)`:**
        *   **(Document parameters, response, and example usage)**

    *   **CopyBot Methods (If Applicable):** (Document any CopyBot related methods like `get_follow_list()`, `get_recent_transactions()`)

    *   **Utility Methods:** (Document any utility methods in the API)

*   **Authentication and Rate Limits:**
    *   Explain how authentication is handled for the Market Data API (if applicable).
    *   Document any rate limits imposed by the API and how to handle them (e.g., using delays, error handling).

*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Describe common error codes and exceptions that may be returned by the API.
    *   Provide guidance on how to handle errors gracefully in agents and strategies.

## Data Storage

The `afz1` project primarily uses CSV files for data storage within the `src/data/` directory. Data is organized into subdirectories based on source or agent type:

*   **`src/data/CSV Data Files`**:  Various CSV files store agent outputs, historical market data, backtesting results, and portfolio information. Filenames are descriptive of the data they contain (e.g., `funding_history.csv`, `liquidation_history.csv`, `sentiment_history.csv`).
*   **`src/data/charts/`**: Stores generated charts, potentially from backtesting or data analysis.
*   **`src/data/code_runner/`**: Stores logs and screenshots from the `code_runner_agent.py`.
*   **`src/data/coingecko_results/`**: Stores data retrieved from the CoinGecko API.
*   **`src/data/rbi/`**:  Directory for data related to the `rbi_agent.py`, including backtesting data and research notes.
*   **`src/data/tweets/`**: Stores tweets generated by the `tweet_agent.py`.
*   **`src/data/videos/`**: Stores data related to video analysis (e.g., YouTube transcripts).

## Data Collection Processes

*   **`ohlcv_collector.py`**: This script is responsible for collecting OHLCV market data from exchange APIs. (Explain how to run and configure `ohlcv_collector.py`, data storage location, update frequency).
*   **(Describe data collection processes for other data sources if applicable, e.g., sentiment data collection, news data collection).**

## Adding New Data Sources

(Provide guidance for developers on how to integrate new data sources into the project, including steps for creating new API clients, data parsing, and storage.)

By understanding the data sources, Market Data API, and data handling mechanisms, users can effectively leverage data within the `afz1` project to build powerful trading agents and strategies.
