# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
kye@apac.ai.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

---

## Coding Standards

To maintain code quality and consistency, please adhere to the following standards.

### Type Annotations

- **Mandatory**: All functions and methods must have type annotations.
- **Example**:

  ```python
  def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
      return a + b
  ```

- **Benefits**:
  - Improves code readability.
  - Helps with static type checking tools.

### Docstrings and Documentation

- **Docstrings**: Every public class, function, and method must have a docstring following the [Google Python Style Guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) or [NumPy Docstring Standard](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).
- **Content**:
  - **Description**: Briefly describe what the function or class does.
  - **Args**: List and describe each parameter.
  - **Returns**: Describe the return value(s).
  - **Raises**: List any exceptions that are raised.

- **Example**:

  ```python
  def calculate_mean(values: List[float]) -> float:
      """
      Calculates the mean of a list of numbers.

      Args:
          values (List[float]): A list of numerical values.

      Returns:
          float: The mean of the input values.

      Raises:
          ValueError: If the input list is empty.
      """
      if not values:
          raise ValueError("The input list is empty.")
      return sum(values) / len(values)
  ```

- **Documentation**: Update or create documentation pages if your changes affect the public API.

### Testing

- **Required**: All new features and bug fixes must include appropriate unit tests.
- **Framework**: Use `unittest`, `pytest`, or a similar testing framework.
- **Test Location**: Place tests in the `tests/` directory, mirroring the structure of `swarms/`.
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage to ensure code reliability.
- **Running Tests**: Provide instructions for running tests.

  ```bash
  pytest tests/
  ```

### Code Style

- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines.
- **Linting Tools**: Use `flake8`, `black`, or `pylint` to check code style.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistency with the existing codebase.

---

## Areas Needing Contributions

We have several areas where contributions are particularly welcome.

### Writing Tests

- **Goal**: Increase test coverage to ensure the library's robustness.
- **Tasks**:
  - Write unit tests for existing code in `swarms/`.
  - Identify edge cases and potential failure points.
  - Ensure tests are repeatable and independent.

### Improving Documentation

#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is

# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#   https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml, but it is recommended to not include it
#   in version control.

# Deploying Azure OpenAI in Production: A Comprehensive Guide

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, leveraging cutting-edge technologies has become essential for businesses to stay competitive and provide exceptional services to their customers. One such technology that has gained significant traction is Azure OpenAI, a powerful platform that allows developers to integrate advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities into their applications. Whether you're building a chatbot, a content generation system, or any other AI-powered solution, Azure OpenAI offers a robust and scalable solution for production-grade deployment.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk through the process of setting up and deploying Azure OpenAI in a production environment. We'll dive deep into the code, provide clear explanations, and share best practices to ensure a smooth and successful implementation.

## Prerequisites:
Before we begin, it's essential to have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Python**: You'll need to have Python installed on your system. This guide assumes you're using Python 3.6 or later.
2. **Azure Subscription**: You'll need an active Azure subscription to access Azure OpenAI services.
3. **Azure OpenAI Resource**: Create an Azure OpenAI resource in your Azure subscription.
4. **Python Packages**: Install the required Python packages, including `python-dotenv` and `swarms`.

## Setting up the Environment:
To kick things off, we'll set up our development environment and install the necessary dependencies.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**: It's a best practice to create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies from the rest of your system. You can create a virtual environment using `venv` or any other virtual environment management tool of your choice.

```
python -m venv myenv
```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Activate the virtual environment to ensure that any packages you install are isolated within the environment.

```
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install Required Packages**: Install the `python-dotenv` and `swarms` packages using pip.

```
pip install python-dotenv swarms
```

4. **Create a `.env` File**: In the root directory of your project, create a new file called `.env`. This file will store your Azure OpenAI credentials and configuration settings.

```
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<your_azure_openai_endpoint>
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=<your_azure_openai_deployment_name>
OPENAI_API_VERSION=<your_openai_api_version>
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_azure_openai_api_key>
AZURE_OPENAI_AD_TOKEN=<your_azure_openai_ad_token>
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual Azure OpenAI credentials and configuration settings.

## Connecting to Azure OpenAI:
Now that we've set up our environment, let's dive into the code that connects to Azure OpenAI and interacts with the language model.

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from swarms import AzureOpenAI

# Load the environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Create an instance of the AzureOpenAI class
model = AzureOpenAI(
    azure_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
    deployment_name=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT"),
    openai_api_version=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_VERSION"),
    openai_api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    azure_ad_token=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_AD_TOKEN")
)
```

## Let's break down this code:

1. **Import Statements**: We import the necessary modules, including `os` for interacting with the operating system, `load_dotenv` from `python-dotenv` to load environment variables, and `AzureOpenAI` from `swarms` to interact with the Azure OpenAI service.

2. **Load Environment Variables**: We use `load_dotenv()` to load the environment variables stored in the `.env` file we created earlier.

3. **Create AzureOpenAI Instance**: We create an instance of the `AzureOpenAI` class by passing in the required configuration parameters:
   - `azure_endpoint`: The endpoint URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.
   - `deployment_name`: The name of the deployment you want to use.
   - `openai_api_version`: The version of the OpenAI API you want to use.
   - `openai_api_key`: Your Azure OpenAI API key, which authenticates your requests.
   - `azure_ad_token`: An optional Azure Active Directory (AAD) token for additional security.

Querying the Language Model:
With our connection to Azure OpenAI established, we can now query the language model and receive responses.

```python
# Define the prompt
prompt = "Analyze this load document and assess it for any risks and create a table in markdwon format."

# Generate a response
response = model(prompt)
print(response)
```

## Here's what's happening:

1. **Define the Prompt**: We define a prompt, which is the input text or question we want to feed into the language model.

2. **Generate a Response**: We call the `model` instance with the `prompt` as an argument. This triggers the Azure OpenAI service to process the prompt and generate a response.

3. **Print the Response**: Finally, we print the response received from the language model.

Running the Code:
To run the code, save it in a Python file (e.g., `main.py`) and execute it from the command line:

```
python main.py
```

## Best Practices for Production Deployment:
While the provided code serves as a basic example, there are several best practices to consider when deploying Azure OpenAI in a production environment:

1. **Secure Credentials Management**: Instead of storing sensitive credentials like API keys in your codebase, consider using secure storage solutions like Azure Key Vault or environment variables managed by your cloud provider.

2. **Error Handling and Retries**: Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms to handle potential failures or rate-limiting scenarios.

3. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring strategies to track application performance, identify issues, and gather insights for optimization.

4. **Scalability and Load Testing**: Conduct load testing to ensure your application can handle anticipated traffic volumes and scale appropriately based on demand.

5. **Caching and Optimization**: Explore caching strategies and performance optimizations to improve response times and reduce the load on the Azure OpenAI service.

6. **Integration with Other Services**: Depending on your use case, you may need to integrate Azure OpenAI with other Azure services or third-party tools for tasks like data processing, storage, or analysis.

7. **Compliance and Security**: Ensure your application adheres to relevant compliance standards and security best practices, especially when handling sensitive data.

## Conclusion:
Azure OpenAI is a powerful platform that enables developers to integrate advanced natural language processing capabilities into their applications. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can set up a production-ready environment for deploying Azure OpenAI and start leveraging its capabilities in your projects.

Remember, this guide serves as a starting point, and there are numerous additional features and capabilities within Azure OpenAI that you can explore to enhance your applications further.

## Building Analyst Agents with Swarms to write Business Reports

> Jupyter Notebook accompanying this post is accessible at: [Business Analyst Agent Notebook](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms/blob/master/examples/demos/business_analysis_swarm/business-analyst-agent.ipynb)

Solving a business problem often involves preparing a Business Case Report. This report comprehensively analyzes the problem, evaluates potential solutions, and provides evidence-based recommendations and an implementation plan to effectively address the issue and drive business value. While the process of preparing one requires an experienced business analyst, the workflow can be augmented using AI agents. Two candidates stick out as areas to work on:

- Developing an outline to solve the problem
- Doing background research and gathering data 
  
In this post, we will explore how Swarms agents can be used to tackle a busuiness problem by outlining the solution, conducting background research and generating a preliminary report.

Before we proceed, this blog uses 3 API tools. Please obtain the following keys and store them in a `.env` file in the same folder as this file.

- **[OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api)** as `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **[TavilyAI API](https://app.tavily.com/home)** `TAVILY_API_KEY`
- **[KayAI API](https://www.kay.ai/)** as `KAY_API_KEY`

```python
import dotenv
dotenv.load_dotenv()  # Load environment variables from .env file
```

### Developing an Outline to solve the problem

Assume the business problem is: **How do we improve Nike's revenue in Q3 2024?** We first create a planning agent to break down the problem into dependent sub-problems.


#### Step 1. Defining the Data Model and Tool Schema

Using Pydantic, we define a structure to help the agent generate sub-problems. 

- **QueryType:** Questions are either standalone or involve a combination of multiple others
- **Query:** Defines structure of a question.
- **QueryPlan:** Allows generation of a dependency graph of sub-questions


```python
import enum
from typing import List
from pydantic import Field, BaseModel

class QueryType(str, enum.Enum):
    """Enumeration representing the types of queries that can be asked to a question answer system."""

    SINGLE_QUESTION = "SINGLE"
    MERGE_MULTIPLE_RESPONSES = "MERGE_MULTIPLE_RESPONSES"

class Query(BaseModel):
    """Class representing a single question in a query plan."""

    id: int = Field(..., description="Unique id of the query")
    question: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Question asked using a question answering system",
    )
    dependencies: List[int] = Field(
        default_factory=list,
        description="List of sub questions that need to be answered before asking this question",
    )
    node_type: QueryType = Field(
        default=QueryType.SINGLE_QUESTION,
        description="Type of question, either a single question or a multi-question merge",
    )

class QueryPlan(BaseModel):
    """Container class representing a tree of questions to ask a question answering system."""

    query_graph: List[Query] = Field(
        ..., description="The query graph representing the plan"
    )

    def _dependencies(self, ids: List[int]) -> List[Query]:
        """Returns the dependencies of a query given their ids."""
        
        return [q for q in self.query_graph if q.id in ids]
```

Also, a `tool_schema` needs to be defined. It is an instance of `QueryPlan` and is used to initialize the agent.

```python
tool_schema = QueryPlan(
    query_graph = [query.dict() for query in [
        Query(
            id=1,
            question="How do we improve Nike's revenue in Q3 2024?",
            dependencies=[2],
            node_type=QueryType('SINGLE')
        ),
        # ... other queries ...
    ]]
)
```

#### Step 2. Defining the Planning Agent

We specify the query, task specification and an appropriate system prompt.

```python
from swarm_models import OpenAIChat
from swarms import Agent

query = "How do we improve Nike's revenue in Q3 2024?"
task = f"Consider: {query}. Generate just the correct query plan in JSON format."
system_prompt = (
        "You are a world class query planning algorithm " 
        "capable of breaking apart questions into its " 
        "dependency queries such that the answers can be " 
        "used to inform the parent question. Do not answer " 
        "the questions, simply provide a correct compute " 
        "graph with good specific questions to ask and relevant " 
        "dependencies. Before you call the function, think " 
        "step-by-step to get a better understanding of the problem."
    )
llm = OpenAIChat(
    temperature=0.0, model_name="gpt-4", max_tokens=4000
)
```

Then, we proceed with agent definition.

```python
# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Query Planner",
    system_prompt=system_prompt,
    # Set the tool schema to the JSON string -- this is the key difference
    tool_schema=tool_schema,
    llm=llm,
    max_loops=1,
    autosave=True,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    interactive=False,
    # Set the output type to the tool schema which is a BaseModel
    output_type=tool_schema, # or dict, or str
    metadata_output_type="json",
    # List of schemas that the agent can handle
    list_base_models=[tool_schema],
    function_calling_format_type="OpenAI",
    function_calling_type="json", # or soon yaml
)
```

#### Step 3. Obtaining Outline from Planning Agent 

We now run the agent, and since its output is in JSON format, we can load it as a dictionary.

```python
generated_data = agent.run(task)
```

At times the agent could return extra content other than JSON. Below function will filter it out.

```python
def process_json_output(content):
    # Find the index of the first occurrence of '```json\n'
    start_index = content.find('```json\n')
    if start_index == -1:
        # If '```json\n' is not found, return the original content
        return content
    # Return the part of the content after '```json\n' and remove the '```' at the end
    return content[start_index + len('```json\n'):].rstrip('`')

# Use the function to clean up the output
json_content = process_json_output(generated_data.content)

import json

# Load the JSON string into a Python object
json_object = json.loads(json_content)

# Convert the Python object back to a JSON string
json_content = json.dumps(json_object, indent=2)

# Print the JSON string
print(json_content)
```

Below is the output this produces

```json
{
  "main_query": "How do we improve Nike's revenue in Q3 2024?",
  "sub_queries": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "query": "What is Nike's current revenue trend?"
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "query": "What are the projected market trends for the sports apparel industry in 2024?"
    },
    {
      "id": "3",
      "query": "What are the current successful strategies being used by Nike's competitors?",
      "dependencies": [
        "2"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "4",
      "query": "What are the current and projected economic conditions in Nike's major markets?",
      "dependencies": [
        "2"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "5",
      "query": "What are the current consumer preferences in the sports apparel industry?",
      "dependencies": [
        "2"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "6",
      "query": "What are the potential areas of improvement in Nike's current business model?",
      "dependencies": [
        "1"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "7",
      "query": "What are the potential new markets for Nike to explore in 2024?",
      "dependencies": [
        "2",
        "4"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "8",
      "query": "What are the potential new products or services Nike could introduce in 2024?",
      "dependencies": [
        "5"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "9",
      "query": "What are the potential marketing strategies Nike could use to increase its revenue in Q3 2024?",
      "dependencies": [
        "3",
        "5",
        "7",
        "8"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "10",
      "query": "What are the potential cost-saving strategies Nike could implement to increase its net revenue in Q3 2024?",
      "dependencies": [
        "6"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The JSON dictionary is not convenient for humans to process. We make a directed graph out of it.

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import textwrap
import random

# Create a directed graph
G = nx.DiGraph()

# Define a color map
color_map = {}

# Add nodes and edges to the graph
for sub_query in json_object['sub_queries']:
    # Check if 'dependencies' key exists in sub_query, if not, initialize it as an empty list
    if 'dependencies' not in sub_query:
        sub_query['dependencies'] = []
    # Assign a random color for each node
    color_map[sub_query['id']] = "#{:06x}".format(random.randint(0, 0xFFFFFF))
    G.add_node(sub_query['id'], label=textwrap.fill(sub_query['query'], width=20))
    for dependency in sub_query['dependencies']:
        G.add_edge(dependency, sub_query['id'])

# Draw the graph
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=800, node_color=[color_map[node] for node in G.nodes()], node_shape="o", alpha=0.5, linewidths=40)

# Prepare labels for legend
labels = nx.get_node_attributes(G, 'label')
handles = [plt.Line2D([0], [0], marker='o', color=color_map[node], label=f"{node}: {label}", markersize=10, linestyle='None') for node, label in labels.items()]

# Create a legend
plt.legend(handles=handles, title="Queries", bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')

plt.show()
```

This produces the below diagram which makes the plan much more convenient to understand.

### Doing Background Research and Gathering Data

At this point, we have solved the first half of the problem. We have an outline consisting of sub-problems to to tackled to solve our business problem. This will form the overall structure of our report. We now need to research information for each sub-problem in order to write an informed report. This mechanically intensive and is the aspect that will most benefit from Agentic intervention. 

Essentially, we can spawn parallel agents to gather the data. Each agent will have 2 tools:

- Internet access
- Financial data retrieval

As they run parallelly, they will add their knowledge into a common long-term memory. We will then spawn a separate report writing agent with access to this memory to generate our business case report.

#### Step 4. Defining Tools for Worker Agents

Let us first define the 2 tools. 

```python
import os
from typing import List, Dict

from swarms import tool

os.environ['TAVILY_API_KEY'] = os.getenv('TAVILY_API_KEY')
os.environ["KAY_API_KEY"] = os.getenv('KAY_API_KEY')

from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field

from kay.rag.retrievers import KayRetriever

def browser(query: str) -> str:
    """

#### Step 5. Defining Long-Term Memory

As mentioned previously, the worker agents running parallelly, will pool their knowledge into a common memory. Let us define that.

```python
import logging
import os
import uuid
from typing import Callable, List, Optional

import chromadb
import numpy as np
from dotenv import load_dotenv

from swarms.utils.data_to_text import data_to_text
from swarms.utils.markdown_message import display_markdown_message
from swarms_memory import  AbstractVectorDatabase


# Results storage using local ChromaDB
class ChromaDB(AbstractVectorDatabase):
    """

    ChromaDB database

    Args:
        metric (str): The similarity metric to use.
        output (str): The name of the collection to store the results in.
        limit_tokens (int, optional): The maximum number of tokens to use for the query. Defaults to 1000.
        n_results (int, optional): The number of results to retrieve. Defaults to 2.

    Methods:
        add: _description_
        query: _description_

    Examples:

    def __init__(

    ):
        self.metric = metric
        self.output_dir = output_dir
        self.limit_tokens = limit_tokens
        self.n_results = n_results
        self.docs_folder = docs_folder

                print(f"{file} added to Database")

        return added_to_db
```

We can now proceed to initialize the memory.

```python
from chromadb.utils import embedding_functions
default_ef = embedding_functions.DefaultEmbeddingFunction()

memory = ChromaDB(
    metric="cosine",
    n_results=3,
    output_dir="results",
    embedding_function=default_ef
)
```

#### Step 6. Defining Worker Agents 

The Worker Agent sub-classes the `Agent` class. The only different between these 2 is in how the `run()` method works. In the `Agent` class, `run()` simply returns the set of tool commands to run, but does not execute it. We, however, desire this. In addition, after we run our tools, we get the relevant information as output. We want to add this information to our memory. Hence, to incorporate these 2 changes, we define `WorkerAgent` as follows.

```python
class WorkerAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    
    def run(self, task, *args, **kwargs):
        response = super().run(task, *args, **kwargs)
        print(response.content)

        json_dict = json.loads(process_json_output(response.content))

        #print(json.dumps(json_dict, indent=2))
        
        if response!=None:
            try:
                commands = json_dict["commands"]
            except:
                commands = [json_dict['command']]
                
            for command in commands:
                tool_name = command["name"]

                if tool_name not in ['browser', 'kay_retriever']:
                    continue
                
                query = command["args"]["query"]

                # Get the tool by its name
                tool = globals()[tool_name]
                tool_response = tool(query)

                # Add tool's output to long term memory
                self.long_term_memory.add(tool_response)
```

We can then instantiate an object of the `WorkerAgent` class.

```python
worker_agent = WorkerAgent(
    agent_name="Worker Agent",
    system_prompt=(
        "Autonomous agent that can interact with browser, "
        "financial data retriever and other agents. Be Helpful " 
        "and Kind. Use the tools provided to assist the user. "
        "Generate the plan with list of commands in JSON format."
    ),
    llm=OpenAIChat(
    temperature=0.0, model_name="gpt-4", max_tokens=4000
),
    max_loops="auto",
    autosave=True,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    stopping_token="<DONE>",
    interactive=True,
    tools=[browser, kay_retriever],
    long_term_memory=memory,
    code_interpreter=True,
)
```

#### Step 7. Running the Worker Agents

At this point, we need to setup a concurrent workflow. While the order of adding tasks to the workflow doesn't matter (since they will all run concurrently late when executed), we can take some time to define an order for these tasks. This order will come in handy later when writing the report using our Writer Agent. 

The order we will follow is Breadth First Traversal (BFT) of the sub-queries in the graph we had made earlier (shown below again for reference). BFT makes sense to be used here because we want all the dependent parent questions to be answered before answering the child question. Also, since we could have independent subgraphs, we will also perform BFT separately on each subgraph.

![Query Plan Mini](../assets/img/docs/query-plan-mini.png)

Below is the code that produces the order of processing sub-queries.

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

# Define the graph nodes
nodes = json_object['sub_queries']

# Create a graph from the nodes
graph = defaultdict(list)
for node in nodes:
    for dependency in node['dependencies']:
        graph[dependency].append(node['id'])

# Find all nodes with no dependencies (potential starting points)
start_nodes = [node['id'] for node in nodes if not node['dependencies']]

# Adjust the BFT function to handle dependencies correctly
def bft_corrected(start, graph, nodes_info):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    order = []
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if node not in visited:
            # Check if all dependencies of the current node are visited
            node_dependencies = [n['id'] for n in nodes if n['id'] == node][0]
            dependencies_met = all(dep in visited for dep in nodes_info[node_dependencies]['dependencies'])
            
            if dependencies_met:
                visited.add(node)
                order.append(node)
                # Add only nodes to the queue whose dependencies are fully met
                for next_node in graph[node]:
                    if all(dep in visited for dep in nodes_info[next_node]['dependencies']):
                        queue.append(next_node)
            else:
                # Requeue the node to check dependencies later
                queue.append(node)
    
    return order

# Dictionary to access node information quickly
nodes_info = {node['id']: node for node in nodes}

# Perform BFT for each unvisited start node using the corrected BFS function
visited_global = set()
bfs_order = []

for start in start_nodes:
    if start not in visited_global:
        order = bft_corrected(start, graph, nodes_info)
        bfs_order.extend(order)
        visited_global.update(order)

print("BFT Order:", bfs_order)
```

This produces the following output.

```python
BFT Order: ['1', '6', '10', '2', '3', '4', '5', '7', '8', '9']
```

Now, let's define our `ConcurrentWorkflow` and run it.

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from swarms import Agent, ConcurrentWorkflow, OpenAIChat, Task

# Create a workflow
workflow = ConcurrentWorkflow(max_workers=5)
task_list = []

for node in bfs_order:
    sub_query =nodes_info[node]['query']
    task = Task(worker_agent, sub_query)
    print('-----------------')
    print("Added task: ", sub_query)
    print('-----------------')
    task_list.append(task)

workflow.add(tasks=task_list)

# Run the workflow
workflow.run()
```

Below is part of the output this workflow produces. We clearly see the thought process of the agent and the plan it came up to solve a particular sub-query. In addition, we see the tool-calling schema it produces in `"command"`.

```python
...
...
content='\n{\n  "thoughts": {\n    "text": "To find out Nike\'s current revenue trend, I will use the financial data retriever tool to search for \'Nike revenue trend\'.",\n    "reasoning": "The financial data retriever tool allows me to search for specific financial data, so I can look up the current revenue trend of Nike.", \n    "plan": "Use the financial data retriever tool to search for \'Nike revenue trend\'. Parse the result to get the current revenue trend and format that into a readable report."\n  },\n  "command": {\n    "name": "kay_retriever", \n    "args": {\n      "query": "Nike revenue trend"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```' response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 152, 'prompt_tokens': 1527, 'total_tokens': 1679}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}
Saved agent state to: Worker Agent_state.json

{
  "thoughts": {
    "text": "To find out Nike's current revenue trend, I will use the financial data retriever tool to search for 'Nike revenue trend'.",
    "reasoning": "The financial data retriever tool allows me to search for specific financial data, so I can look up the current revenue trend of Nike.", 
    "plan": "Use the financial data retriever tool to search for 'Nike revenue trend'. Parse the result to get the current revenue trend and format that into a readable report."
  },
  "command": {
    "name": "kay_retriever", 
    "args": {
      "query": "Nike revenue trend"
    }
  }
}

-----------------
Document added successfully
-----------------
...
...
```

Here, `"name"` pertains to the name of the tool to be called and `"args"` is the arguments to be passed to the tool call. Like mentioned before, we modify `Agent`'s default behaviour in `WorkerAgent`. Hence, the tool call is executed here and its results (information from web pages and Kay Retriever API) are added to long-term memory. We get confirmation for this from the message `Document added successfully`. 


#### Step 7. Generating the report using Writer Agent

At this point, our Worker Agents have gathered all the background information required to generate the report. We have also defined a coherent structure to write the report, which is following the BFT order to answering the sub-queries. Now it's time to define a Writer Agent and call it sequentially in the order of sub-queries. 

```python
from swarms import Agent, OpenAIChat, tool

agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Writer Agent",
    agent_description=(
        "This agent writes reports based on information in long-term memory"
    ),
    system_prompt=(
        "You are a world-class financial report writer. " 
        "Write analytical and accurate responses using memory to answer the query. "
        "Do not mention use of long-term memory in the report. "
        "Do not mention Writer Agent in response."
        "Return only response content in strict markdown format."
    ),
    llm=OpenAIChat(temperature=0.2, model='gpt-3.5-turbo'),
    max_loops=1,
    autosave=True,
    verbose=True,
    long_term_memory=memory,
)
```

The report individual sections of the report will be collected in a list.

```python
report = []
```

Let us now run the writer agent.

```python
for node in bfs_order:
    sub_query =nodes_info[node]['query']
    print("Running task: ", sub_query)
    out = agent.run(f"Consider: {sub_query}. Write response in strict markdown format using long-term memory. Do not mention Writer Agent in response.")
    print(out)
    try:
        report.append(out.content)
    except:
        pass
```

Now, we need to clean up the repoort a bit to make it render professionally. 

```python
# Remove any content before the first "#" as that signals start of heading
# Anything before this usually contains filler content
stripped_report = [entry[entry.find('#'):] if '#' in entry else entry for entry in report]
report = stripped_report

# At times the LLM outputs \\n instead of \n
cleaned_report = [entry.replace("\\n", "\n") for entry in report]
import re

# Function to clean up unnecessary metadata from the report entries
def clean_report(report):
    cleaned_report = []
    for entry in report:
        # This pattern matches 'response_metadata={' followed by any characters that are not '}' (non-greedy), 
        # possibly nested inside other braces, until the closing '}'.
        cleaned_entry = re.sub(r"response_metadata=\{[^{}]*(?:\{[^{}]*\}[^{}]*)*\}", "", entry, flags=re.DOTALL)
        cleaned_report.append(cleaned_entry)
    return cleaned_report

# Apply the cleaning function to the markdown report
cleaned_report = clean_report(cleaned_report)
```

After cleaning, we append parts of the report together to get out final report.

```python
final_report = ' \n '.join(cleaned_report)
```

In Jupyter Notebook, we can use the below code to render it in Markdown. 

```python
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

display(Markdown(final_report))
```

# **Swarms Goals & Milestone Tracking: A Vision for 2024 and Beyond**

As we propel Swarms into a new frontier, we’ve set ambitious yet achievable goals for the coming years that will solidify Swarms as a leader in multi-agent 
orchestration. This document outlines our vision, the goals for 2024 and 2025, and how we track our progress through meticulously designed milestones and metrics.

## **Our Vision: The Agentic Ecosystem**

We envision an ecosystem where agents are pervasive and serve as integral collaborators in business processes, daily life, and complex problem-solving. By leveraging 
the collective intelligence of swarms, we believe we can achieve massive gains in productivity, scalability, and impact. Our target is to establish the Swarms platform as the go-to environment for deploying and managing agents at an unprecedented scale—making agents as common and indispensable as mobile apps are today. This future 
will see agents integrated into nearly every digital interaction, creating a seamless extension of human capability and reducing the cognitive load on individuals and organizations.

We believe that *agents* will transition from being simple tools to becoming full-fledged partners that can understand user needs, predict outcomes, and adapt to 
changes dynamically. Our vision is not just about increasing numbers; it’s about building a smarter, more interconnected agentic ecosystem where every agent has a purpose and contributes to a collective intelligence that continuously evolves. By cultivating a diverse array of agents capable of handling various specialized tasks, we aim to create an environment in which these digital collaborators function as a cohesive whole—one that can amplify human ingenuity and productivity beyond current limits.

## **Goals for 2024 and 2025**

To achieve our vision, we have laid out a structured growth trajectory for Swarms, driven by clear numerical targets:

1. **End of 2024: 500 Million Agents**  
   Currently, our platform hosts **45 million agents**. By the end of 2024, our goal is to reach **500 million agents** deployed on Swarms. This means achieving sustained exponential growth, which will require doubling or even tripling the total number of agents roughly **every month** from now until December 2024. Such growth will necessitate not only scaling infrastructure but also improving the ease with which users can develop and deploy agents, expanding educational resources, and fostering a vibrant community that drives innovation in agent design. To achieve this milestone, we plan to invest heavily in making our platform user-friendly, including simplifying onboarding processes and providing extensive educational content. Additionally, we aim to build out our infrastructure to support the necessary scalability and ensure the seamless operation of a growing number of agents. Beyond merely scaling in numbers, we are also focused on increasing the diversity of tasks that agents can perform, thereby enhancing the practical value of deploying agents on Swarms.

2. **End of 2025: 10 Billion+ Agents**  
   The long-term vision extends further to reach **10 billion agents** by the end of 2025. This ambitious goal reflects not only the organic growth of our user base but 
   also the increasing role of swarms in business applications, personal projects, and global problem-solving initiatives. This goal requires continuous monthly 
   doubling of agents and a clear roadmap of user engagement and deployment. By scaling to this level, we envision Swarms as a cornerstone of automation and productivity enhancement, where agents autonomously manage everything from mundane tasks to sophisticated strategic decisions, effectively enhancing human capabilities. This expansion will rely on the development of a robust ecosystem in which users can easily create, share, and enhance agents. We will foster partnerships with industries that can benefit from scalable agentic solutions—spanning healthcare, finance, education, and beyond. Our strategy includes developing domain-specific templates and specialized agents that cater to niche needs, thereby making Swarms an indispensable solution for businesses and individuals alike.

## **Tracking Progress: The Power of Metrics**

Achieving these goals is not just about reaching numerical targets but ensuring that our users are deriving tangible value from Swarms and deploying agents effectively. To measure success, we’ve defined several key performance indicators (KPIs) and milestones:

### 1. Growth in Agent Deployment

The **number of agents** deployed per month will be our primary growth metric. With our goal of **doubling agent count every month**, this metric serves as an overall health indicator for platform adoption and usage. Growth in deployment indicates that our platform is attracting users who see value in creating and deploying agents to solve diverse challenges.

**Key Milestones:**

- **November 2024**: Surpass 250 million agents.  

- **December 2024**: Reach 500 million agents.  

- **June 2025**: Break the 5 billion agents mark.  

- **December 2025**: Hit 10 billion agents.  


To accomplish this, we must continually expand our infrastructure, maintain scalability, and create a seamless user onboarding process. We’ll ensure that adding agents is frictionless and that our platform can accommodate this rapid growth. By integrating advanced orchestration capabilities, we will enable agents to form more complex collaborations and achieve tasks that previously seemed out of reach. Furthermore, we will develop analytics tools to track the success and efficiency of these agents, giving users real-time feedback to optimize their deployment strategies.


### 2. Agents Deployed Per User: Engagement Indicator

A core belief of Swarms is that agents are here to make life easier for their users—whether it’s automating mundane tasks, handling complex workflows, or enhancing creative endeavors. Therefore, we measure the **number of agents deployed per user per month** as a key metric for engagement. Tracking this metric allows us to understand how effectively our users are utilizing the platform, and how deeply agents are becoming embedded into their workflows.

This metric ensures that users aren’t just joining Swarms, but they are actively building and deploying agents to solve real problems. Our milestone for engagement is to see **increasing growth in agents deployed per user** month over month, which indicates a deeper integration of Swarms into daily workflows and business processes. We want our users to view Swarms as their go-to solution for any problem they face, which means ensuring that agents are providing real, tangible benefits.


**Key Milestones:**

- **November 2024**: Achieve an average of 20 agents deployed per user each month. 

- **June 2025**: Target 100-200+ agents deployed per user.  


To drive these numbers, we plan to improve user support, enhance educational materials, host workshops, and create an environment that empowers users to deploy agents for increasingly complex use-cases. Additionally, we will introduce templates and pre-built agents that users can customize, reducing the barriers to entry and enabling 
rapid deployment for new users. We are also developing gamified elements that reward users for deploying more agents and achieving milestones, fostering a competitive and engaging community atmosphere.

### 3. Active vs. Inactive Agents: Measuring Churn

The **number of inactive agents per user** is an essential metric for understanding our **churn rate**. An agent is considered inactive when it remains undeployed or unused for a prolonged period, indicating that it’s no longer delivering value to the user. Churn metrics provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of our agents and highlight areas where improvements are needed.

We aim to **minimize the number of inactive agents**, as this will be a direct reflection of how well our agents are designed, integrated, and supported. A low churn rate means that users are finding long-term utility in their agents, which is key to our mission. Our platform’s success depends on users consistently deploying agents 
that remain active and valuable over time.

**Key Milestones:**

- **December 2024**: Ensure that no more than **30%** of deployed agents are inactive.  

- **December 2025**: Aim for **10%** or lower, reflecting strong agent usefulness and consistent platform value delivery.  


Reducing churn will require proactive measures, such as automated notifications to users about inactive agents, recommending potential uses, and implementing agent retraining features to enhance their adaptability over time. Educating users on prompting engineering, tool engineering, and RAG engineering also helps decrease these numbers as the number of inactive agents is evident that the user is not automating a business operation with that agent. We will also integrate machine learning models to predict agent inactivity and take corrective actions before agents become dormant. By offering personalized recommendations to users on how to enhance or repurpose inactive agents, we hope to ensure that all deployed agents are actively contributing value.

## **Milestones and Success Criteria**

To reach these ambitious goals, we have broken our roadmap down into a series of actionable milestones:

1. **Infrastructure Scalability (Q1 2025)**  
   We will work on ensuring that our backend infrastructure can handle the scale required to reach 500 million agents by the end of 2024. This includes expanding server capacity, improving agent orchestration capabilities, and ensuring low latency across deployments. We will also focus on enhancing our database management systems to ensure efficient storage and retrieval of agent data, enabling seamless operation at a massive scale. Our infrastructure roadmap also includes implementing advanced load balancing techniques and predictive scaling mechanisms to ensure high availability and reliability.

2. **Improved User Experience (Q2 2025)**  
   To encourage agent deployment and reduce churn, we will introduce new onboarding flows, agent-building wizards, and intuitive user interfaces. We will also implement 
   in-depth tutorials and documentation to simplify agent creation for new users. By making agent-building accessible even to those without programming expertise, we 
   will open the doors to a broader audience and drive exponential growth in the number of agents deployed. Additionally, we will integrate AI-driven suggestions and 
   contextual help to assist users at every step of the process, making the platform as intuitive as possible.

3. **Agent Marketplace (Q3 2025)**  
   Launching the **Swarms Marketplace** for agents, prompts, and tools will allow users to share, discover, and even monetize their agents. This marketplace will be a crucial driver in both increasing the number of agents deployed and reducing inactive agents, as it will create an ecosystem of continuously evolving and highly useful agents. Users will have the opportunity to browse agents that others have developed, which can serve as inspiration or as a starting point for their own projects. We will also introduce ratings, reviews, and community feedback mechanisms to ensure that the most effective agents are highlighted and accessible.

4. **Community Engagement and Swarms Education (Ongoing)**  
   Workshops, webinars, and events will be conducted throughout 2024 and 2025 to engage new users and educate them on building effective agents. The goal is to ensure that every user becomes proficient in deploying swarms of agents for meaningful tasks. We will foster an active community where users can exchange ideas, get help, and collaborate on projects, ultimately driving forward the growth of the Swarms ecosystem. We also plan to establish a mentor program where experienced users can guide newcomers, helping them get up to speed more quickly and successfully deploy agents.

1. **Set Clear Expectations**: Define what success looks like for each task. Be clear about the outputs and outcomes we expect. This will guide our testing and development efforts.

2. **Develop Testing Scenarios**: Create a comprehensive list of testing scenarios that cover both common and edge cases. This will help us ensure that our Swarm can handle a wide range of situations.

3. **Write Test Cases**: For each scenario, write detailed test cases that outline the exact steps to be followed, the inputs to be used, and the expected outputs.

4. **Execute the Tests**: Run the test cases on our Swarm, making note of any issues or bugs that arise.

5. **Iterate and Improve**: Based on the results of our tests, iterate and improve our Swarm. This may involve fixing bugs, optimizing code, or redesigning parts of our system.

6. **Repeat**: Repeat this process until our Swarm meets our expectations and passes all test cases.

By following these steps, we will systematically build, test, and improve our Swarm until it reaches the Phase 3 level. This methodical approach will help us ensure that we create a reliable, high-performing, and scalable Swarm that can truly automate all digital activities.

Let's shape the future of digital automation together!

# Demo Ideas

* We could also try to create an AI influencer run by a swarm, let it create a whole identity and generate images, memes, and other content for Twitter, Reddit, etc.

* had a thought that we should have either a more general one of these or a swarm or both -- need something connecting all the calendars, events, and initiatives of all the AI communities, langchain, laion, eluther, lesswrong, gato, rob miles, chatgpt hackers, etc etc

* Swarm of AI influencers to spread marketing

* Delegation System to better organize teams: Start with a team of passionate humans and let them self-report their skills/strengths so the agent has a concept of who to delegate to, then feed the agent a huge task list (like the bullet list a few messages above) that it breaks down into actionable steps and "prompts" specific team members to complete tasks. Could even suggest breakout teams of a few people with complementary skills to tackle more complex tasks. There can also be a live board that updates each time a team member completes something, to encourage momentum and keep track of progress

### Philosophy

Swarms is designed with a philosophy of simplicity and reliability. We believe that software should be a tool that empowers users, not a hurdle that they need to overcome. Therefore, our focus is on usability, reliability, speed, and scalability. We want our users to find Swarms intuitive and dependable, fast and adaptable to their needs. This philosophy guides all of our design and development decisions.

# Swarm Architecture Design Document

## Overview

The goal of the Swarm Architecture is to provide a flexible and scalable system to build swarm intelligence models that can solve complex problems. This document details the proposed design to create a plug-and-play system, which makes it easy to create custom swarms, and provides pre-configured swarms with multi-modal agents.

## Design Principles

- **Modularity**: The system will be built in a modular fashion, allowing various components to be easily swapped or upgraded.
- **Interoperability**: Different swarm classes and components should be able to work together seamlessly.
- **Scalability**: The design should support the growth of the system by adding more components or swarms.
- **Ease of Use**: Users should be able to easily create their own swarms or use pre-configured ones with minimal configuration.

## Design Components

### BaseSwarm

The BaseSwarm is an abstract base class which defines the basic structure of a swarm and the methods that need to be implemented. Any new swarm should inherit from this class and implement the required methods.

### Swarm Classes

Various Swarm classes can be implemented inheriting from the BaseSwarm class. Each swarm class should implement the required methods for initializing the components, worker nodes, and boss node, and running the swarm.

Pre-configured swarm classes with multi-modal agents can be provided for ease of use. These classes come with a default configuration of tools and agents, which can be used out of the box.

### Tools and Agents

Tools and agents are the components that provide the actual functionality to the swarms. They can be language models, AI assistants, vector stores, or any other components that can help in problem solving.

To make the system plug-and-play, a standard interface should be defined for these components. Any new tool or agent should implement this interface, so that it can be easily plugged into the system.

## Usage

Users can either use pre-configured swarms or create their own custom swarms.

To use a pre-configured swarm, they can simply instantiate the corresponding swarm class and call the run method with the required objective.

To create a custom swarm, they need to:

1. Define a new swarm class inheriting from BaseSwarm.
2. Implement the required methods for the new swarm class.
3. Instantiate the swarm class and call the run method.

### Example

```python
# Using pre-configured swarm
swarm = PreConfiguredSwarm(openai_api_key)
swarm.run_swarms(objective)

# Creating custom swarm
class CustomSwarm(BaseSwarm):
    # Implement required methods

swarm = CustomSwarm(openai_api_key)
swarm.run_swarms(objective)
```

## Conclusion

This Swarm Architecture design provides a scalable and flexible system for building swarm intelligence models. The plug-and-play design allows users to easily use pre-configured swarms or create their own custom swarms.


# Swarming Architectures
Sure, below are five different swarm architectures with their base requirements and an abstract class that processes these components:

1. **Hierarchical Swarm**: This architecture is characterized by a boss/worker relationship. The boss node takes high-level decisions and delegates tasks to the worker nodes. The worker nodes perform tasks and report back to the boss node. 
    - Requirements: Boss node (can be a large language model), worker nodes (can be smaller language models), and a task queue for task management.

2. **Homogeneous Swarm**: In this architecture, all nodes in the swarm are identical and contribute equally to problem-solving. Each node has the same capabilities.
    - Requirements: Homogeneous nodes (can be language models of the same size), communication protocol for nodes to share information.

3. **Heterogeneous Swarm**: This architecture contains different types of nodes, each with its specific capabilities. This diversity can lead to more robust problem-solving.
    - Requirements: Different types of nodes (can be different types and sizes of language models), a communication protocol, and a mechanism to delegate tasks based on node capabilities.

4. **Competitive Swarm**: In this architecture, nodes compete with each other to find the best solution. The system may use a selection process to choose the best solutions.
    - Requirements: Nodes (can be language models), a scoring mechanism to evaluate node performance, a selection mechanism.

5. **Cooperative Swarm**: In this architecture, nodes work together and share information to find solutions. The focus is on cooperation rather than competition.
    - Requirements: Nodes (can be language models), a communication protocol, a consensus mechanism to agree on solutions.


6. **Grid-based Swarm**: This architecture positions agents on a grid, where they can only interact with their neighbors. This is useful for simulations, especially in fields like ecology or epidemiology.
    - Requirements: Agents (can be language models), a grid structure, and a neighborhood definition (i.e., how to identify neighboring agents).

7. **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Swarm**: In this architecture, each agent represents a potential solution to an optimization problem. Agents move in the solution space based on their own and their neighbors' past performance. PSO is especially useful for continuous numerical optimization problems.
    - Requirements: Agents (each representing a solution), a definition of the solution space, an evaluation function to rate the solutions, a mechanism to adjust agent positions based on performance.

8. **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Swarm**: Inspired by ant behavior, this architecture has agents leave a pheromone trail that other agents follow, reinforcing the best paths. It's useful for problems like the traveling salesperson problem.
    - Requirements: Agents (can be language models), a representation of the problem space, a pheromone updating mechanism.

9. **Genetic Algorithm (GA) Swarm**: In this architecture, agents represent potential solutions to a problem. They can 'breed' to create new solutions and can undergo 'mutations'. GA swarms are good for search and optimization problems.
    - Requirements: Agents (each representing a potential solution), a fitness function to evaluate solutions, a crossover mechanism to breed solutions, and a mutation mechanism.

10. **Stigmergy-based Swarm**: In this architecture, agents communicate indirectly by modifying the environment, and other agents react to such modifications. It's a decentralized method of coordinating tasks.
    - Requirements: Agents (can be language models), an environment that agents can modify, a mechanism for agents to perceive environment changes.

These architectures all have unique features and requirements, but they share the need for agents (often implemented as language models) and a mechanism for agents to communicate or interact, whether it's directly through messages, indirectly through the environment, or implicitly through a shared solution space. Some also require specific data structures, like a grid or problem space, and specific algorithms, like for evaluating solutions or updating agent positions.

   *Mitigation Strategy*: Focus on core features and allow greater flexibility in the interface. Adopting a modular approach where developers can pick and choose the features they want could also be helpful.

9. **Leaky Abstraction Problem**: Langchain’s full-on framework approach has created a leaky abstraction problem leading to a disappointing developer experience.

   *Mitigation Strategy*: Adopt a more balanced approach between a library and a framework. Provide a solid core feature set with the possibility to extend it according to the developers' needs. 

10. **Excessive Focus on Third-party Services**: Langchain overly focuses on supporting every single third-party service at the expense of customizability and fine-tuning for actual applications.

   *Mitigation Strategy*: Prioritize fine-tuning and customizability for developers, limiting the focus on third-party services unless they provide substantial value.
   
Remember, any mitigation strategy will need to be tailored to Langchain's particular circumstances and developer feedback. It's also important to consider potential trade-offs and unintended consequences when implementing these strategies.

### FAQ on Swarm Intelligence and Multi-Agent Systems

#### What is an agent in the context of AI and swarm intelligence?

In artificial intelligence (AI), an agent refers to an LLM with some objective to accomplish.

In swarm intelligence, each agent interacts with other agents and possibly the environment to achieve complex collective behaviors or solve problems more efficiently than individual agents could on their own.


#### What do you need Swarms at all?
Individual agents are limited by a vast array of issues such as context window loss, single task execution, hallucination, and no collaboration.


#### How does a swarm work?

A swarm works through the principles of decentralized control, local interactions, and simple rules followed by each agent. Unlike centralized systems, where a single entity dictates the behavior of all components, in a swarm, each agent makes its own decisions based on local information and interactions with nearby agents. These local interactions lead to the emergence of complex, organized behaviors or solutions at the collective level, enabling the swarm to tackle tasks efficiently.

#### Why do you need more agents in a swarm?

More agents in a swarm can enhance its problem-solving capabilities, resilience, and efficiency. With more agents:

- **Diversity and Specialization**: The swarm can leverage a wider range of skills, knowledge, and perspectives, allowing for more creative and effective solutions to complex problems.
- **Scalability**: Adding more agents can increase the swarm's capacity to handle larger tasks or multiple tasks simultaneously.
- **Robustness**: A larger number of agents enhances the system's redundancy and fault tolerance, as the failure of a few agents has a minimal impact on the overall performance of the swarm.

#### Isn't it more expensive to use more agents?

While deploying more agents can initially increase costs, especially in terms of computational resources, hosting, and potentially API usage, there are several factors and strategies that can mitigate these expenses:

- **Efficiency at Scale**: Larger swarms can often solve problems more quickly or effectively, reducing the overall computational time and resources required.
- **Optimization and Caching**: Implementing optimizations and caching strategies can reduce redundant computations, lowering the workload on individual agents and the overall system.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Utilizing cloud services that offer dynamic scaling can ensure you only pay for the resources you need when you need them, optimizing cost-efficiency.

#### Can swarms make decisions better than individual agents?

Yes, swarms can make better decisions than individual agents for several reasons:

- **Collective Intelligence**: Swarms combine the knowledge and insights of multiple agents, leading to more informed and well-rounded decision-making processes.
- **Error Correction**: The collaborative nature of swarms allows for error checking and correction among agents, reducing the likelihood of mistakes.
- **Adaptability**: Swarms are highly adaptable to changing environments or requirements, as the collective can quickly reorganize or shift strategies based on new information.

#### How do agents in a swarm communicate?

Communication in a swarm can vary based on the design and purpose of the system but generally involves either direct or indirect interactions:

- **Direct Communication**: Agents exchange information directly through messaging, signals, or other communication protocols designed for the system.
- **Indirect Communication**: Agents influence each other through the environment, a method known as stigmergy. Actions by one agent alter the environment, which in turn influences the behavior of other agents.

#### Are swarms only useful in computational tasks?

While swarms are often associated with computational tasks, their applications extend far beyond. Swarms can be utilized in:

- **Robotics**: Coordinating multiple robots for tasks like search and rescue, exploration, or surveillance.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Using sensor networks to monitor pollution, wildlife, or climate conditions.
- **Social Sciences**: Modeling social behaviors or economic systems to understand complex societal dynamics.
- **Healthcare**: Coordinating care strategies in hospital settings or managing pandemic responses through distributed data analysis.

#### How do you ensure the security of a swarm system?

Security in swarm systems involves:

- **Encryption**: Ensuring all communications between agents are encrypted to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation.
- **Authentication**: Implementing strict authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of each agent in the swarm.
- **Resilience to Attacks**: Designing the swarm to continue functioning effectively even if some agents are compromised or attacked, utilizing redundancy and fault tolerance strategies.

#### How do individual agents within a swarm share insights without direct learning mechanisms like reinforcement learning?

In the context of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) that operate within a swarm, sharing insights typically involves explicit communication and data exchange protocols rather than direct learning mechanisms like reinforcement learning. Here's how it can work:

- **Shared Databases and Knowledge Bases**: Agents can write to and read from a shared database or knowledge base where insights, generated content, and relevant data are stored. This allows agents to benefit from the collective experience of the swarm by accessing information that other agents have contributed.
  
- **APIs for Information Exchange**: Custom APIs can facilitate the exchange of information between agents. Through these APIs, agents can request specific information or insights from others within the swarm, effectively sharing knowledge without direct learning.

#### How do you balance the autonomy of individual LLMs with the need for coherent collective behavior in a swarm?

Balancing autonomy with collective coherence in a swarm of LLMs involves:

- **Central Coordination Mechanism**: Implementing a lightweight central coordination mechanism that can assign tasks, distribute information, and collect outputs from individual LLMs. This ensures that while each LLM operates autonomously, their actions are aligned with the swarm's overall objectives.

- **Standardized Communication Protocols**: Developing standardized protocols for how LLMs communicate and share information ensures that even though each agent works autonomously, the information exchange remains coherent and aligned with the collective goals.

#### How do LLM swarms adapt to changing environments or tasks without machine learning techniques?

Adaptation in LLM swarms, without relying on machine learning techniques for dynamic learning, can be achieved through:

- **Dynamic Task Allocation**: A central system or distributed algorithm can dynamically allocate tasks to different LLMs based on the changing enviro
