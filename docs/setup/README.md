# Setup and Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the `afz1` project environment and installing all necessary dependencies.

## System Requirements

*   **Operating System:**  (Specify compatible OS, e.g., Linux, macOS, Windows)
*   **Python Version:** (Specify required Python version, e.g., Python 3.9+)
*   **Hardware:** (Recommend hardware if applicable, e.g., RAM, CPU)

## Prerequisites

*   **Python:** Ensure Python (version specified above) is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
*   **Venv (Recommended):**  It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment manager `venv` (comes with Python) to isolate project dependencies.
*   **Git:** Git is required to clone the project repository. Install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

## Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the `afz1` project. Then, run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]  # Replace with the actual repository URL
    cd afz1
    ```

2.  **Environment Setup:**
    Navigate into the cloned `afz1` directory in your terminal.

    *   **Using venv (Example):**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
        venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
        ```
    *   **Using Conda (Example):**
        ```bash
        conda create -n afz1_env python=[Python version]  # Replace [Python version]
        conda activate afz1_env
        ```

3.  **Dependency Installation:**
    Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Environment Variables Configuration:**
    *   Copy the `.env_example` file to `.env`:
        ```bash
        cp .env_example .env  # On Linux/macOS
        copy .env_example .env  # On Windows
        ```
    *   Open the `.env` file and fill in the necessary environment variables, such as API keys for exchanges, AI models, and other services.
    **Important Security Note:** Never commit the `.env` file with your actual API keys to version control. Keep your API keys secure.

5.  **Initial Configuration (If Applicable):**
    (Describe any project-specific initial configuration steps here, e.g., running setup scripts, database initialization, etc.)

## Verification

To verify that the installation was successful, you can run a basic script or agent (provide example command here).

## Troubleshooting (Basic)

*   **Dependency Conflicts:** If you encounter issues during `pip install`, try upgrading `pip` and `setuptools`:
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
    ```
    If conflicts persist, consider creating a fresh virtual environment.
*   **Python Version Issues:** Ensure you are using the correct Python version as specified in the System Requirements.
*   **Environment Variable Errors:** Double-check that you have correctly configured all necessary environment variables in the `.env` file.
