# Journal - Day 1 - 2025-02-23

## Date and Time
2025-02-23, 8:50 PM (Atlantic/Canary, UTC+0:00)

## Topic of Discussion
New features and implementations for the `afz1` project.

## Areas Discussed
- Integration with More Exchanges/Data Sources
    - Initial focus on Injective Protocol integration.
    - Explored Injective Protocol API and documentation (briefly).
    - Decision to set aside Injective Protocol integration for now due to documentation access limitations.
    - Re-focused discussion on alternative integration options and new features.

## Decisions Made
- Set aside Injective Protocol integration for the time being.
- Shift focus to exploring other integration options or new features for `afz1`.
- Create a journal file (`docs/journal_day1.md`) to track daily progress.

## Next Steps
- Re-focus discussion on alternative integration options (Coinbase Pro, Kraken, KuCoin, Bybit, Bitfinex, TradingView, CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap, Glassnode/Nansen, sentiment analysis APIs) or new agent implementations from the roadmap.
