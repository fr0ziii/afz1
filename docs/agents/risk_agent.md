# Risk Agent (`risk_agent.py`)

## Purpose

The Risk Agent serves as a crucial component within the `afz1` framework, providing a centralized and extensible platform for managing and monitoring trading risk across various agents and strategies. By offering a robust risk management foundation, the Risk Agent aims to:

*   **Centralized Risk Monitoring:** Provide a unified system for monitoring and tracking risk exposure across all trading agents and portfolio holdings within the `afz1` project, offering a consolidated view of overall risk levels.
*   **Customizable Risk Assessment Framework:** Offer a flexible and customizable framework for implementing diverse risk assessment methodologies, allowing users to define and incorporate various risk metrics, models, and parameters tailored to their specific trading strategies and risk preferences.
*   **Automated Risk Alerting and Notifications:**  Enable automated generation of real-time risk alerts and notifications when predefined risk thresholds are breached, ensuring timely awareness of critical risk events and prompting proactive risk mitigation actions.
*   **Support for Diverse Risk Management Strategies:**  Provide a foundation for implementing a wide range of risk management strategies, from basic stop-loss mechanisms to more advanced dynamic position sizing and portfolio hedging techniques, allowing for sophisticated risk control within automated trading systems.
*   **Extensibility and Modularity:**  Being designed as an abstract base class, the Risk Agent promotes extensibility and modularity, allowing developers to create specialized risk agent subclasses tailored to specific risk types, trading strategies, or market conditions, ensuring adaptability and scalability of the risk management framework.

In essence, the Risk Agent acts as a guardian of capital within the `afz1` ecosystem, providing essential tools and infrastructure for building robust and risk-aware automated trading systems.

## Functionality

As an abstract base class, the Risk Agent provides a flexible framework for implementing diverse risk management functionalities, which are expected to be implemented in concrete subclasses:

*   **Modular Risk Metric Calculation:**
    - **Volatility Metrics:**  Subclasses will implement methods to calculate various volatility metrics, such as: Standard Deviation, Average True Range (ATR), Historical Volatility, and implied volatility (if applicable).
    - **Drawdown Metrics:**  Implement drawdown tracking algorithms to monitor portfolio drawdowns, calculate maximum drawdown, and track drawdown duration and recovery.
    - **Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES):**  Incorporate statistical methods or models to estimate Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for the portfolio, quantifying potential losses under different confidence levels and scenarios.
    - **Correlation and Beta Analysis:**  Implement correlation analysis tools to assess the relationships between assets in the portfolio and calculate portfolio beta to measure systematic risk exposure.
    - **Liquidity Risk Metrics:** (Future) Potentially incorporate liquidity risk metrics to assess the ease of liquidating portfolio positions under adverse market conditions.
*   **Configurable Risk Threshold Monitoring and Alerting:**
    - **Threshold-Based Monitoring:**  Subclasses will monitor calculated risk metrics against user-defined thresholds for different risk indicators (e.g., volatility threshold, drawdown limit, VaR threshold).
    - **Customizable Alerting Rules:**  Allow users to define custom alerting rules based on risk metric breaches, triggering alerts when portfolio risk exceeds acceptable levels.
    - **Alert Delivery Mechanisms:**  Implement various alert delivery methods (e.g., console alerts, email notifications, webhook integrations) to ensure timely risk notifications.
*   **Automated Risk Mitigation and Actionable Responses:**
    - **Dynamic Position Sizing Adjustment:**  Subclasses may implement logic to automatically adjust position sizes based on real-time risk assessments, reducing exposure when risk levels increase and potentially increasing exposure when risk is within acceptable limits.
    - **Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Order Management:**  Incorporate automated stop-loss and take-profit order placement and adjustment mechanisms to limit potential losses and secure profits based on risk parameters and market conditions.
    - **Portfolio Hedging Strategies:** (Future) Explore and implement automated hedging strategies (e.g., using futures contracts or options) to reduce overall portfolio risk exposure during periods of high market uncertainty or volatility.
*   **Comprehensive Risk Reporting and Analytics:**
    - **Risk Dashboard and Visualization:**  Generate interactive risk dashboards and visualizations to provide users with a clear and intuitive overview of portfolio risk exposure, key risk metrics, and historical risk trends.
    - **定期 Risk Reports:**  Generate periodic risk reports (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) summarizing portfolio risk metrics, risk attribution analysis, and risk management actions taken by the agent.
    - **Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing:** (Future) Implement scenario analysis and stress testing tools to evaluate portfolio performance under various hypothetical market stress scenarios, helping users assess portfolio resilience and prepare for extreme market events.

## AI Model(s) Used

Concrete Risk Agent subclasses, implementing specific risk management strategies, could strategically incorporate AI models to enhance their capabilities:

*   **Enhanced Risk Prediction and Forecasting:**
    - **Volatility Forecasting with Deep Learning:**  Utilize advanced time series forecasting models, particularly deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformer Networks, to predict future asset volatility and correlations of cryptocurrency assets with higher accuracy.
    - **Market Regime Prediction with Machine Learning:**  Employ machine learning classifiers to identify and predict shifts in market regimes (e.g., bull vs. bear markets, high vs. low volatility regimes), enabling proactive adjustments to risk management strategies based on anticipated market conditions.
*   **Dynamic and Adaptive Risk Thresholds:**
    - **AI-Driven Threshold Optimization:**  Use machine learning optimization algorithms to dynamically adjust risk thresholds (e.g., volatility limits, drawdown limits, VaR thresholds) based on real-time market conditions, portfolio performance, and predicted risk levels, optimizing the balance between risk control and trading activity.
    - **Personalized Risk Thresholds:**  Develop AI-powered personalized risk profiles for individual users, tailoring risk thresholds and alerting parameters to match their specific risk tolerance, investment goals, and trading styles.
*   **AI for Risk-Based Asset Allocation and Position Sizing:**
    - **Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Allocation:**  Implement Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to dynamically optimize asset allocation within the portfolio, continuously learning and adapting allocation strategies based on real-time risk assessments, market dynamics, and portfolio performance feedback.
    - **AI-Powered Position Sizing Algorithms:**  Utilize machine learning models to develop dynamic position sizing algorithms that automatically adjust trade sizes based on predicted asset volatility, portfolio risk exposure, and user-defined risk limits, optimizing risk-adjusted returns and capital preservation.
*   **Anomaly Detection and Risk Event Prediction:**
    - **Anomaly Detection for Unusual Market Behavior:**  Employ anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual or statistically significant deviations in market data, price movements, or trading activity that may signal increased risk levels or potential market crashes.
    - **Risk Event Prediction Models:**  Train machine learning classifiers to predict potential risk events (e.g., flash crashes, extreme volatility spikes) based on historical market data and real-time risk indicator patterns, enabling proactive risk mitigation and hedging actions.

## Data Inputs

The Risk Agent requires a variety of data inputs to perform comprehensive risk assessment and management:

*   **Cryptocurrency Market Data Feeds:**
    - **Price Data:** Historical and real-time price data for all assets in the portfolio, including OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data, used to calculate returns, volatility, correlations, and other risk metrics.
    - **Volume Data:** Trading volume data to assess asset liquidity and market activity, potentially used as a risk factor or for dynamic position sizing adjustments.
    - **Exchange API Data:** Market data is typically sourced from cryptocurrency exchange APIs (e.g., Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) or data aggregators that provide comprehensive market data feeds.
*   **User Portfolio Data:**
    - **Portfolio Holdings:** Real-time data on the user's current portfolio holdings, including asset balances, positions sizes, entry prices, and transaction history.
    - **Account Balance Data:**  Information on the user's available account balances and capital allocation, used for risk-based position sizing and capital management.
*   **Risk-Free Rate Data (Optional):**
    - **Benchmark Risk-Free Rate Data:** Data on a benchmark risk-free rate (e.g., yield on stablecoins or government bonds) for calculating risk-adjusted return metrics such as Sharpe Ratio and Sortino Ratio.
    - **Data Sources:** Financial data APIs or economic data providers that offer risk-free rate information.
*   **User-Defined Risk Parameters and Configuration Settings:**
    - **Risk Tolerance Profile:** User-specified risk tolerance level (e.g., conservative, moderate, aggressive) or custom risk aversion parameters.
    - **Risk Metric Thresholds:** User-defined thresholds for various risk metrics (e.g., maximum portfolio volatility, maximum drawdown limits, VaR limits) that trigger risk alerts or mitigation actions.
    - **RBI Strategy Configuration:** (For RBI Agent subclasses) Configuration parameters specific to the Risk-Based Investing strategy being implemented (e.g., volatility targeting parameters, risk parity allocation settings).
    - **Alerting Preferences:** User preferences for risk alerting methods (e.g., console alerts, email notifications, webhook integrations) and notification frequency.

## Configuration Parameters

*   **agent\_id**: A unique identifier for the agent instance.
*   **agent\_type**: Must be set to `RiskAgent`.
*   **Risk-Specific Configuration (To be defined in subclasses):** Concrete subclasses will define their own configuration parameters for risk metrics, thresholds, and mitigation strategies.

### Example Configuration (YAML - Base Class)

```yaml
config:
  agent_id: risk_agent_base_01
  agent_type: RiskAgent
```

## Example Usage

To use the `RiskAgent`, you would typically create a subclass that implements specific risk management logic and then instantiate and run the subclassed agent. The base `RiskAgent` class itself is abstract and not meant to be run directly.

```python
# Example of how a concrete subclass might be implemented (conceptual)
from src.agents.risk_agent import RiskAgent

class VolatilityRiskAgent(RiskAgent):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__(config)
        # Load volatility-specific configuration
        self.volatility_threshold = config.get("volatility_threshold", 0.05) # Example config

    def run(self):
        # Implement volatility monitoring and risk assessment logic here
        portfolio_volatility = self.calculate_portfolio_volatility() # Example method
        if portfolio_volatility > self.volatility_threshold:
            self._log_error(f"Portfolio volatility breached threshold: {portfolio_volatility}")
            # Implement risk mitigation actions (e.g., send alert)

        self._log_info("Risk monitoring cycle completed")

# Example configuration for the concrete subclass
config = {
    "agent_id": "volatility_risk_agent_01",
    "agent_type": "VolatilityRiskAgent", # Assuming VolatilityRiskAgent is the subclass name
    "volatility_threshold": 0.06 # Example volatility threshold
}

agent = VolatilityRiskAgent(config)
agent.run()
```

**Note:** The `VolatilityRiskAgent` example above is conceptual and would require further implementation of risk calculation and mitigation methods.

## Output and Monitoring

*   **Risk Assessments (Output by subclasses):** Concrete subclasses will output risk assessments, such as calculated risk metrics and risk levels.
*   **Risk Reports (Output by subclasses):** Subclasses will generate risk reports with detailed risk analysis.
*   **Risk Alerts (Output by subclasses):** Subclasses will trigger alerts when risk thresholds are breached.
*   **Logs:**  Logs basic agent activity and configuration loading from the base class. Subclasses should extend logging for their specific functionalities.

## Customization Notes

*   **Create Concrete Subclasses:**  To implement specific risk management strategies, you need to create concrete subclasses of `RiskAgent` and implement the abstract methods and functionalities.
*   **Implement Risk Metric Calculations:**  Within subclasses, implement methods to calculate relevant risk metrics based on market and portfolio data.
*   **Define Risk Thresholds and Alerts:**  Configure risk thresholds and implement alerting mechanisms within subclasses to notify users of significant risk events.
