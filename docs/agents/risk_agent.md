# Risk Agent

## Description

The Risk Agent is designed for managing and monitoring trading risk within the afz1 framework. It provides a foundational framework for agents that can assess, monitor, and manage various types of trading risks. This agent is intended to be extended and customized to implement specific risk management strategies, risk assessment models, and risk mitigation actions. It serves as a crucial component for building robust and risk-aware trading systems.

## Missions

[Description of the missions this agent is designed to accomplish. Link to mission files if applicable.]
- Currently, no specific mission files are defined for the Risk Agent. Missions would be defined based on the specific risk management strategies, risk types to be monitored, and risk mitigation actions it is intended to handle.

## Configuration

The Risk Agent inherits basic configuration parameters from the `BaseAgent`. Subclasses are expected to override the `load_config` method to implement risk-specific configuration loading and validation. Specific configurations for risk assessment models, risk thresholds, and risk management actions would be defined in the agent's configuration.

-   **agent_id**: A unique identifier for the agent instance.
-   **agent_type**: Must be set to `RiskAgent`.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
config:
  agent_id: risk_agent_01
  agent_type: RiskAgent
  # Add any risk management specific configurations here in the future
  # e.g., risk_thresholds, risk_metrics, risk_management_strategy
```

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs

-   **Market Data**: Market data relevant for risk assessment (e.g., price volatility, trading volume, order book data).
-   **Portfolio Data**: Data on current portfolio holdings, positions, and balances.
-   **Risk Configuration**: Configuration parameters defining risk thresholds, risk metrics, and risk management strategies.

### Outputs

-   **Risk Assessments**:  Quantified risk assessments based on configured risk models and metrics.
-   **Risk Reports**:  Reports summarizing current risk levels, risk exposures, and potential risk events.
-   **Risk Alerts**:  Alerts triggered when risk levels exceed predefined thresholds or when critical risk events are detected.
-   **Risk Mitigation Actions**: (Future) Actions taken to mitigate identified risks, such as adjusting position sizes, stop-loss orders, or hedging strategies.
-   **Logs**: Informational and error logs for monitoring agent activity and debugging.

## Workflow

1.  **Load Configuration**: The agent loads and validates risk-specific configuration parameters, potentially overriding the base `load_config` method.
2.  **Setup Dependencies**: The agent sets up risk-specific dependencies, such as connections to portfolio tracking APIs or risk data providers, by overriding the `setup_dependencies` method.
3.  **Assess Risk**: The agent assesses trading risk based on configured risk models, market data, and portfolio data (currently placeholder logic in the base class, expected to be implemented in subclasses).
4.  **Monitor Risk Levels**: The agent continuously monitors risk levels and compares them against predefined risk thresholds (currently placeholder logic).
5.  **Generate Risk Reports and Alerts**: The agent generates risk reports summarizing risk assessments and triggers alerts when risk levels exceed thresholds (currently placeholder logic).
6.  **Take Mitigation Actions**: (Future) In future implementations, the agent can automatically take risk mitigation actions based on predefined strategies.
7.  **Log Activity**: The agent logs risk assessment activities, risk levels, generated reports and alerts, and any risk mitigation actions taken for monitoring and analysis.

## Example Usage

To run the Risk Agent, you would typically create a subclass of `RiskAgent` to implement specific risk management logic and then instantiate and run the subclassed agent.  The base `RiskAgent` class is abstract and requires subclassing to be functional.

```python
from src.agents.risk_agent import RiskAgent

class MyRiskAgent(RiskAgent): # Example subclass implementing specific risk logic
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__(config)

    def load_config(self, config: dict) -> dict:
        config = super().load_config(config)
        # Load and validate risk-specific configurations here
        # Example: risk_threshold = config.get("risk_threshold")
        return config

    def setup_dependencies(self):
        super().setup_dependencies()
        # Initialize risk-specific dependencies here

    def run(self):
        super().run()
        # Implement risk management logic here, e.g., assess_portfolio_risk()

config = {
  "agent_id": "my_risk_agent_01",
  "agent_type": "MyRiskAgent", # Use the subclass name here
  # Add risk-specific configurations here
}

agent = MyRiskAgent(config) # Instantiate the subclassed agent
# agent.run() # Run method to execute risk management logic (to be implemented in subclass)
```

This example shows how to create a subclass `MyRiskAgent` that extends the base `RiskAgent` to implement custom risk management logic. The `run` method in the subclass would contain the specific risk assessment and monitoring logic.

## Code Location

-   `src/agents/risk_agent.py`

## Components

-   **`src/agents/base_agent.py` (BaseAgent)**: The Risk Agent inherits basic agent functionalities from the `BaseAgent`.
-   **Risk Assessment Models (To be implemented in subclasses)**: Subclasses would implement specific risk assessment models and algorithms.
-   **Risk Monitoring Components (To be implemented in subclasses)**: Subclasses would implement components for monitoring risk levels and triggering alerts.
-   **Risk Reporting Components (Future)**: Components for generating risk reports and visualizations.
-   **Risk Mitigation Components (Future)**: Components for implementing automated risk mitigation actions.

## Notes and Considerations

-   **Abstract Base Class**: The `RiskAgent` is designed as an abstract base class. It needs to be subclassed to implement concrete risk management strategies.
-   **Subclass Implementation**:  Significant implementation is required in subclasses to add specific risk assessment models, monitoring logic, and risk mitigation actions.
-   **Risk Model Selection**:  Carefully select and implement appropriate risk assessment models and metrics relevant to cryptocurrency trading and portfolio risk management.
-   **Customization**:  The Risk Agent framework is highly customizable. Subclasses can be tailored to implement a wide range of risk management strategies and risk profiles.
-   **Integration with Trading Agents**:  The Risk Agent is intended to be integrated with other trading agents to provide risk-aware decision-making and portfolio management within the afz1 framework.
