# Agent Documentation Plan

This document outlines the plan for creating detailed documentation for each agent in the project.

## Goals

- Provide comprehensive documentation for each agent.
- Explain the purpose, functionality, and configuration of each agent.
- Make it easy for users to understand and use the agents.
- Ensure documentation is consistent and well-organized.

## Structure for each Agent Documentation File

Each agent documentation file (e.g., `docs/agents/chartanalysis_agent.md`) should include the following sections:

1.  **Agent Name**: The name of the agent (e.g., Chart Analysis Agent).
2.  **Description**: A detailed description of the agent's purpose and functionality. What problem does it solve? What tasks does it perform?
3.  **Missions**: A description of the missions this agent is designed to accomplish. Link to mission files if applicable (e.g., `agent_missions/chartanalysis_agent.md`).
4.  **Configuration**: Explain any configurable parameters for the agent. How can users customize the agent's behavior? Include examples of configuration settings.
5.  **Inputs and Outputs**: Describe the inputs the agent expects and the outputs it produces. What data does it consume and generate?
6.  **Workflow**: Outline the typical workflow or process the agent follows. Step-by-step explanation of how the agent operates.
7.  **Example Usage**: Provide practical examples of how to use the agent. Show use cases and scenarios where the agent is effective.
8.  **Code Location**: Specify the location of the agent's code (e.g., `src/agents/chartanalysis_agent.py`).
9.  **Components**: List and describe the components used by the agent (e.g., `src/components/chart_data_provider.py`, `src/components/pattern_recognizer.py`). Explain how these components contribute to the agent's functionality.
10. **Notes and Considerations**: Include any important notes, limitations, or considerations for using the agent. Potential issues, best practices, or future improvements.

## Next Steps

1.  Create the agent documentation files based on this plan.
2.  Populate each file with detailed information about the respective agent.
3.  Update `docs/agents/README.md` and `docs/README.md` to include links to the new agent documentation.
