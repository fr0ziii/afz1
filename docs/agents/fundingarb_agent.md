# Funding Arbitrage Agent

## Description

The Funding Arbitrage Agent is designed for identifying and executing funding rate arbitrage opportunities in cryptocurrency markets. It provides a basic framework for agents that can detect discrepancies in funding rates across different exchanges or trading pairs and capitalize on these differences through arbitrage strategies. This agent is valuable for advanced traders looking to exploit funding rate inefficiencies for profit.

## Missions

[Description of the missions this agent is designed to accomplish. Link to mission files if applicable.]
- Currently, no specific mission files are defined for the Funding Arbitrage Agent. Missions would be defined based on the specific arbitrage strategies and funding rate discrepancy detection methods it is intended to handle.

## Configuration

The Funding Arbitrage Agent inherits basic configuration parameters from the `BaseAgent`. Specific configurations for arbitrage strategies, exchange connections, trading pairs, and risk parameters would be defined in the agent's configuration.

-   **agent_id**: A unique identifier for the agent instance.
-   **agent_type**: Must be set to `FundingArbAgent`.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
config:
  agent_id: fundingarb_agent_01
  agent_type: FundingArbAgent
  # Add any funding rate arbitrage specific configurations here in the future
  # e.g., exchanges, arbitrage_pairs, funding_rate_threshold_difference, trade_size
```

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs

-   **Funding Rate Data**: Real-time funding rate data from multiple cryptocurrency exchanges.
-   **Order Book Data**: Order book data for executing arbitrage trades.
-   **Exchange Account Information**: API keys and account details for connected exchanges.

### Outputs

-   **Arbitrage Trades**: Trades executed to capitalize on funding rate arbitrage opportunities.
-   **Profit/Loss Tracking**: Metrics tracking the profit and loss from arbitrage trades.
-   **Alerts**: Alerts for identified arbitrage opportunities or execution issues.
-   **Logs**: Informational and error logs for monitoring agent activity and debugging.

## Workflow

1.  **Fetch Funding Rate Data**: The agent fetches real-time funding rate data from multiple configured cryptocurrency exchanges (currently placeholder logic).
2.  **Identify Arbitrage Opportunities**: The agent analyzes funding rate data to identify arbitrage opportunities based on funding rate discrepancies between exchanges or trading pairs (currently placeholder logic).
3.  **Execute Arbitrage Trades**: When an arbitrage opportunity is identified, the agent executes trades on the relevant exchanges to capitalize on the funding rate difference (currently placeholder logic).
4.  **Track Performance**: The agent tracks the performance of arbitrage trades, including profit and loss.
5.  **Log Activity**: The agent logs all arbitrage activities, trade executions, and performance metrics for monitoring and analysis.

## Example Usage

To run the Funding Arbitrage Agent, you would instantiate and run the agent, configuring it with exchange connections, trading pairs, and arbitrage strategy parameters. Since the current implementation is basic, the example usage primarily involves setting up the agent and potentially adding arbitrage logic.

```python
from src.agents.fundingarb_agent import FundingArbAgent

config = {
  "agent_id": "fundingarb_agent_01",
  "agent_type": "FundingArbAgent",
}

agent = FundingArbAgent(config)
# agent.run() # Run method currently placeholder
# Example of configuring exchanges and arbitrage pairs (to be implemented)
# config["exchanges"] = ["Binance", "FTX"]
# config["arbitrage_pairs"] = ["BTC/USDT"]
# agent = FundingArbAgent(config)
# agent.start_arbitrage_trading() # Method to initiate arbitrage trading (to be implemented)
```

This example shows the basic instantiation of the Funding Arbitrage Agent. The `run` method is currently a placeholder and would need to be implemented with actual arbitrage trading logic. Future implementations would include methods to configure exchanges, arbitrage pairs, and initiate arbitrage trading.

## Code Location

-   `src/agents/fundingarb_agent.py`

## Components

-   **`src/agents/base_agent.py` (BaseAgent)**: The Funding Arbitrage Agent inherits basic agent functionalities from the `BaseAgent`.
-   **Funding Rate Data Components (To be implemented)**: Future implementations would include components for fetching funding rate data from multiple cryptocurrency exchanges.
-   **Exchange Integration Components (To be implemented)**: Components for connecting to and interacting with multiple cryptocurrency exchanges for order placement and data retrieval.
-   **Arbitrage Strategy Components (Future)**: Components implementing specific funding rate arbitrage strategies and logic for opportunity detection and trade execution.
-   **Risk Management Components (Future)**: Components for managing risks associated with arbitrage trading, such as slippage and execution failures.

## Notes and Considerations

-   **Placeholder Implementation**: The current `FundingArbAgent` is a basic placeholder. Significant implementation is required to add actual arbitrage trading capabilities.
-   **Exchange Integration**:  Implementing exchange integration would involve handling API connections, authentication, and order placement across multiple exchanges.
-   **Arbitrage Strategy Design**:  Designing effective funding rate arbitrage strategies requires careful consideration of transaction costs, slippage, and execution speed.
-   **Risk Management in Arbitrage**:  Arbitrage trading involves specific risks, such as execution failures and rapid changes in funding rates. Robust risk management is essential.
-   **Monitoring and Alerting**:  Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting to track arbitrage opportunities, trade executions, and potential issues.
