# Copy Bot Agent

## Description

The Copy Bot Agent is designed for implementing copy trading strategies. It provides a basic framework for agents that can automatically replicate the trades of other successful traders or strategies. This agent can be used to mirror trading activities, learn from successful strategies, or diversify trading approaches by following multiple sources.

## Missions

[Description of the missions this agent is designed to accomplish. Link to mission files if applicable.]
- Currently, no specific mission files are defined for the Copy Bot Agent. Missions would be defined based on the copy trading strategies to be implemented and the sources to be followed.

## Configuration

The Copy Bot Agent inherits basic configuration parameters from the `BaseAgent`. Specific configurations for copy trading sources, risk parameters, and trade execution settings would be defined in the agent's configuration.

-   **agent_id**: A unique identifier for the agent instance.
-   **agent_type**: Must be set to `CopyBotAgent`.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
config:
  agent_id: copybot_agent_01
  agent_type: CopyBotAgent
  # Add any copy trading specific configurations here in the future
  # e.g., source_trader_id, risk_factor, trading_pair_mapping
```

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs

-   **Source Trader Signals/Trades**: Data feeds or signals from source traders or strategies to be copied.
-   **Market Data**: Real-time market data for trade execution.
-   **Configuration Parameters**: Settings for copy trading behavior, risk management, and trade execution.

### Outputs

-   **Copied Trades**: Trades executed based on the signals from source traders.
-   **Performance Metrics**: Metrics tracking the performance of the copy trading strategy.
-   **Logs**: Informational and error logs for monitoring agent activity and debugging.

## Workflow

1.  **Receive Source Signals**: The agent receives trading signals or trade executions from configured source traders or strategies (currently placeholder logic).
2.  **Analyze Signals**: The agent analyzes the received signals based on configured risk parameters and trading logic (currently placeholder logic).
3.  **Execute Trades**: The agent executes trades in the connected exchange account, mirroring the actions of the source traders (currently placeholder logic).
4.  **Monitor Performance**: The agent monitors the performance of the copied trades and tracks relevant metrics.
5.  **Log Activity**: The agent logs all copy trading activities, executions, and performance metrics for monitoring and analysis.

## Example Usage

To run the Copy Bot Agent, you would instantiate and run the agent, configuring it with the source traders or strategies to copy. Since the current implementation is basic, the example usage primarily involves setting up the agent and potentially adding copy trading logic.

```python
from src.agents.copybot_agent import CopyBotAgent

config = {
  "agent_id": "copybot_agent_01",
  "agent_type": "CopyBotAgent",
}

agent = CopyBotAgent(config)
# agent.run() # Run method currently placeholder
# Example of configuring a source trader (to be implemented)
# config["source_trader_id"] = "successful_trader_123"
# agent = CopyBotAgent(config)
# agent.run_copy_trading() # Method to initiate copy trading (to be implemented)
```

This example shows the basic instantiation of the Copy Bot Agent. The `run` method is currently a placeholder and would need to be implemented with actual copy trading logic. Future implementations would include methods to configure source traders and initiate copy trading.

## Code Location

-   `src/agents/copybot_agent.py`

## Components

-   **`src/agents/base_agent.py` (BaseAgent)**: The Copy Bot Agent inherits basic agent functionalities from the `BaseAgent`.
-   **Signal Reception Components (To be implemented)**: Future implementations would include components for receiving and interpreting signals from source traders (e.g., API integrations, data stream handlers).
-   **Trade Execution Components (Future)**: Components for executing trades in connected exchange accounts based on copied signals.
-   **Risk Management Components (Future)**: Components for managing risk in copy trading, such as position sizing and stop-loss mechanisms.

## Notes and Considerations

-   **Placeholder Implementation**: The current `CopyBotAgent` is a basic placeholder. Significant implementation is required to add actual copy trading capabilities.
-   **Source Trader Integration**:  Implementing source trader integration would involve defining APIs or data feeds to receive trading signals from source traders or platforms.
-   **Risk Management**:  Risk management is crucial in copy trading. Implementations must include robust risk management strategies to control potential losses.
-   **Performance Monitoring**:  Implement comprehensive performance monitoring to evaluate the effectiveness of the copy trading strategy and track key metrics.
-   **Legal and Ethical Considerations**:  Consider legal and ethical aspects of copy trading, ensuring compliance with regulations and respecting intellectual property.
