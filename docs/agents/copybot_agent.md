# Copy Bot Agent (`copybot_agent.py`)

## Purpose

The Copy Bot Agent is designed to enable users to implement copy trading strategies within the `afz1` framework. By automatically replicating the trades of other, potentially more experienced or successful traders, or mirroring predefined strategies, this agent offers several key benefits:

*   **Automated Strategy Replication:** Allows users to automatically replicate the trading strategies of successful traders or predefined algorithms without manual intervention.
*   **Leveraging Expert Knowledge:** Enables less experienced traders to potentially benefit from the expertise and strategies of seasoned traders or established trading systems.
*   **Diversification of Strategies:**  Facilitates diversification by allowing users to copy multiple trading strategies or traders simultaneously, potentially reducing risk and improving overall portfolio performance.
*   **Time Efficiency:**  Reduces the time and effort required for manual trading by automating the process of following and executing trades based on external signals.
*   **Learning and Strategy Discovery:**  Provides a way to learn from and analyze the trading approaches of successful traders, potentially leading to improved understanding of trading strategies and market dynamics.

The Copy Bot Agent aims to democratize access to sophisticated trading strategies and automate the execution of copy trading approaches within the `afz1` ecosystem.

## Functionality

The Copy Bot Agent, in its advanced implementations, is expected to offer a comprehensive suite of features for effective copy trading:

*   **Versatile Source Signal Integration:**
    - **External Platform Integration:** Connect to and receive trading signals from external copy trading platforms or social trading networks via APIs.
    - **Internal Agent Signal Copying:**  Copy trades from other agents within the `afz1` ecosystem, such as high-performing `ChartAnalysisAgent` or `SniperAgent` instances.
    - **User-Defined Source Strategies:**  Allow users to define custom trading strategies or algorithms as signal sources for copy trading.
    - **Multiple Source Aggregation:**  Aggregate and combine signals from multiple sources to create more robust and diversified copy trading strategies.
*   **Intelligent Trade Replication and Mapping:**
    - **Signal Interpretation:**  Intelligently interpret and analyze trading signals from various sources, handling different signal formats and data structures.
    - **Order Type Mapping:**  Map source signals to appropriate order types (market, limit, stop-limit) on the user's connected exchange, considering market conditions and strategy requirements.
    - **Parameter Translation:**  Translate and adapt order parameters (price, quantity, stop-loss, take-profit levels) from source signals to be compatible with the user's trading account and risk settings.
*   **Advanced Risk Management and Customization:**
    - **Dynamic Allocation Control:**  Allow users to dynamically allocate capital to different copy trading sources or strategies based on performance, risk scores, or user-defined criteria.
    - **Slippage Management:**  Implement advanced slippage control mechanisms to minimize the impact of slippage during trade replication, especially in volatile market conditions.
    - **Customizable Risk Parameters:**  Provide a wide range of customizable risk parameters, such as maximum allocation per source, stop-loss levels, drawdown limits, and position size scaling factors.
*   **Performance Analytics and Reporting:**
    - **Real-time Performance Tracking:**  Track the performance of copied trades and strategies in real-time, providing users with up-to-date profit/loss, win rate, and other key metrics.
    - **Detailed Trade History and Analysis:**  Maintain a comprehensive history of copied trades, allowing users to analyze past performance, identify successful strategies, and optimize copy trading parameters.
    - **Risk Reporting and Visualization:**  Generate risk reports and visualizations to help users understand and manage the risk associated with their copy trading activities.

## AI Model(s) Used

Future versions of the Copy Bot Agent could strategically incorporate AI models to enhance various aspects of copy trading:

*   **AI for Source Trader/Strategy Analysis and Selection:**
    - **Performance Prediction Models:**  Utilize machine learning models to analyze historical trading data of potential source traders or strategies and predict their future performance, helping users select more profitable sources to copy.
    - **Risk Profiling and Assessment:**  Employ AI-driven risk assessment models to evaluate the risk profiles of source traders, considering factors like drawdown history, risk-adjusted returns, and trading style, enabling users to choose sources that align with their risk tolerance.
    - **Similarity and Style Matching:**  Use AI techniques to analyze the trading style and characteristics of source traders and match them with user preferences or portfolio requirements, facilitating personalized copy trading selections.
*   **AI-Powered Adaptive Copying and Parameter Optimization:**
    - **Dynamic Allocation Adjustment:**  Implement AI-driven dynamic capital allocation algorithms that automatically adjust the allocation of funds to different copy trading sources based on their real-time performance, risk metrics, or changing market conditions.
    - **Parameter Optimization Models:**  Use machine learning models to continuously optimize copy trading parameters, such as position sizing, slippage tolerance, stop-loss levels, and take-profit targets, adapting to market dynamics and source trader behavior.
    - **Strategy Adaptation and Blending:**  Employ AI techniques to dynamically adapt or blend copied strategies based on market regime detection, performance analysis, or user-defined objectives, creating more robust and adaptive copy trading approaches.
*   **AI for Risk Management and Anomaly Detection:**
    - **Risk Anomaly Detection:**  Utilize AI-powered anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual or potentially risky trading behavior from source traders, enabling proactive risk management and alerts.
    - **Real-time Risk Monitoring and Mitigation:**  Implement AI-driven risk monitoring systems that continuously assess the risk exposure of copy trading portfolios and trigger automated risk mitigation actions (e.g., reducing allocation, pausing copying) when risk thresholds are breached.
    - **Fraud Detection and Security Enhancement:**  Employ AI models to detect potentially fraudulent or malicious trading signals or source traders, enhancing the security and reliability of the copy trading process.

## Data Inputs

The Copy Bot Agent relies on various data inputs to function effectively:

*   **Source Trader/Strategy Signals:**
    - **External Copy Trading Platform APIs:** Real-time trading signals and performance data from integrated copy trading platforms or social trading networks via APIs.
    - **Internal Agent Signals:** Trading signals generated by other agents within the `afz1` system that are designated as copy sources (e.g., signals from `ChartAnalysisAgent`, `SniperAgent`).
    - **Custom Strategy Definitions:** User-defined trading strategies or algorithms that serve as signal sources for copy trading.
    - **Signal Format:** Signals can be in various formats, such as API data streams, structured data feeds, or predefined signal messages.
*   **Market Data:**
    - **Real-time Price Data:** Live price feeds for the trading pairs being copied, necessary for order execution and slippage management.
    - **Order Book Data:** (Optional) Order book data for market depth analysis and advanced order placement strategies.
*   **User Configuration and Account Data:**
    - **Exchange API Credentials:** Securely configured API keys and secret keys for accessing the user's cryptocurrency exchange account to execute trades.
    - **Copy Trading Parameters:** User-defined parameters for copy trading strategies, such as allocation amounts, risk settings, slippage tolerance, and selected source traders/strategies.
    - **Portfolio and Account Balance Data:**  Real-time data on the user's portfolio holdings and available account balances for risk management and position sizing.

## Configuration Parameters

*   **agent\_id**: A unique identifier for the agent instance.
*   **agent\_type**: Must be set to `CopyBotAgent`.

### Example Configuration (YAML)

```yaml
config:
