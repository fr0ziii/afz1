# Tweet Agent

## Description

The Tweet Agent is designed for monitoring and analyzing Twitter/X data and trends. It provides a basic framework for agents that can track tweets, analyze tweet sentiment, identify trending topics, and potentially generate signals based on Twitter/X data analysis. This agent can be valuable for traders and analysts who want to incorporate social media sentiment and trends from Twitter/X into their market analysis or trading strategies.

## Missions

[Description of the missions this agent is designed to accomplish. Link to mission files if applicable.]
- Currently, no specific mission files are defined for the Tweet Agent. Missions would be defined based on the specific Twitter/X monitoring tasks, data points to be tracked, and Twitter/X trends it is intended to handle.

## Configuration

The Tweet Agent inherits basic configuration parameters from the `BaseAgent`. Specific configurations for Twitter/X API access, monitoring parameters, and analysis settings would be defined in the agent's configuration.

-   **agent_id**: A unique identifier for the agent instance.
-   **agent_type**: Must be set to `TweetAgent`.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
config:
  agent_id: tweet_agent_01
  agent_type: TweetAgent
  # Add any tweet monitoring specific configurations here in the future
  # e.g., twitter_api_key, twitter_api_secret, monitored_keywords, analysis_parameters
```

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs

-   **Twitter/X Data**: Real-time or historical tweet data from the Twitter/X API, based on monitored keywords, hashtags, or user accounts.
-   **Configuration Parameters**: Configuration settings defining Twitter/X API credentials, monitoring parameters, and analysis settings.

### Outputs

-   **Tweet Sentiment Analysis**: Sentiment scores or indicators derived from analyzing tweet text content.
-   **Trending Topics**: Identification of trending topics or hashtags on Twitter/X related to cryptocurrency markets.
-   **Tweet Alerts**: Alerts triggered by significant sentiment changes, trending topics, or specific tweet content.
-   **Logs**: Informational and error logs for monitoring agent activity and debugging.

## Workflow

1.  **Connect to Twitter/X API**: The agent connects to the Twitter/X API using configured API credentials (currently placeholder logic).
2.  **Monitor Tweets**: The agent monitors tweets based on configured keywords, hashtags, or user accounts (currently placeholder logic).
3.  **Analyze Tweet Sentiment**: The agent analyzes the sentiment of fetched tweets using NLP techniques or sentiment analysis models (currently placeholder logic).
4.  **Identify Trending Topics**: The agent identifies trending topics and hashtags from the monitored tweet data (currently placeholder logic).
5.  **Generate Alerts**: The agent generates alerts based on significant sentiment changes, trending topics, or specific tweet content that meets predefined criteria (currently placeholder logic).
6.  **Output Analysis**:  In future implementations, the agent can output more detailed analysis of tweet sentiment and trends.
7.  **Log Activity**: The agent logs Twitter/X monitoring activities, sentiment analysis results, identified trends, and generated alerts for monitoring and analysis.

## Example Usage

To run the Tweet Agent, you would instantiate and run the agent, configuring it with Twitter/X API credentials and monitoring parameters. Since the current implementation is basic, the example usage primarily involves setting up the agent and potentially adding tweet monitoring logic.

```python
from src.agents.tweet_agent import TweetAgent

config = {
  "agent_id": "tweet_agent_01",
  "agent_type": "TweetAgent",
}

agent = TweetAgent(config)
# agent.run() # Run method currently placeholder
# Example of configuring Twitter API credentials and monitored keywords (to be implemented)
# config["twitter_api_key"] = "YOUR_TWITTER_API_KEY"
# config["twitter_api_secret"] = "YOUR_TWITTER_API_SECRET"
# config["monitored_keywords"] = ["#bitcoin", "#crypto"]
# agent = TweetAgent(config)
# agent.start_tweet_monitoring() # Method to initiate tweet monitoring (to be implemented)
```

This example shows the basic instantiation of the Tweet Agent. The `run` method is currently a placeholder and would need to be implemented with actual tweet monitoring logic. Future implementations would include methods to configure Twitter/X API access and initiate monitoring.

## Code Location

-   `src/agents/tweet_agent.py`

## Components

-   **`src/agents/base_agent.py` (BaseAgent)**: The Tweet Agent inherits basic agent functionalities from the `BaseAgent`.
-   **Twitter/X API Components (To be implemented)**: Future implementations would include components for connecting to the Twitter/X API and fetching tweet data using libraries like Tweepy or similar.
-   **Tweet Analysis Components (Future)**: Components for analyzing tweet data, including sentiment analysis, trend detection, and keyword extraction.
-   **Alerting Components (Future)**: Components for generating and delivering alerts based on tweet sentiment, trending topics, or specific tweet content.

## Notes and Considerations

-   **Placeholder Implementation**: The current `TweetAgent` is a basic placeholder. Significant implementation is required to add actual tweet monitoring and analysis capabilities.
-   **Twitter/X API Integration**:  Implementing Twitter/X API integration requires handling API authentication, rate limits, and data streaming for the Twitter/X API.
-   **Data Source Selection**:  Define relevant keywords, hashtags, and user accounts to monitor on Twitter/X for effective market sentiment analysis.
-   **Sentiment Analysis Techniques**:  Choose appropriate NLP techniques and sentiment analysis models for analyzing tweet text content and deriving meaningful sentiment scores.
-   **Real-time Data Processing**:  Implement real-time data processing pipelines to capture and analyze tweets in a timely manner for relevant market insights.
-   **API Rate Limits and Data Handling**: Be mindful of Twitter/X API rate limits and implement efficient data handling and storage mechanisms to manage large volumes of tweet data.
