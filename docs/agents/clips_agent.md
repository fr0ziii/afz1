# Clips Agent (`clips_agent.py`)

## Purpose

The Clips Agent is designed to automate the creation and management of video clips or short-form video content, specifically tailored for market analysis and updates within the cryptocurrency domain. This agent serves as a foundational framework to streamline the generation of engaging video content for various purposes, including:

*   **Social Media Engagement:** Creating short, attention-grabbing video clips for platforms like Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram to share market insights, attract followers, and increase engagement.
*   **Educational Content:** Generating educational video snippets explaining technical analysis concepts, trading strategies, or market events for users and community members.
*   **Internal Analysis and Reporting:**  Producing video summaries of agent performance, backtesting results, or market condition overviews for internal team reviews and documentation.
*   **Content Marketing and Promotion:**  Developing promotional video content showcasing the capabilities of the `afz1` project and its agents.

By automating video creation, the Clips Agent aims to reduce the manual effort involved in producing visual content, ensure consistent branding, and facilitate efficient communication of market-related information in an engaging format.

## Functionality

The Clips Agent, in its future implementations, is envisioned to offer a range of functionalities for automated video content creation:

*   **Automated Video Generation:**
    - Generate video clips programmatically based on various data inputs and templates.
    - Support for different video formats (e.g., MP4, GIF) and resolutions.
*   **Market Data Visualization:**
    - Create videos visualizing market trends, price charts, technical indicators, and order book data.
    - Overlay charts with technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) and annotations.
*   **Agent Output Summarization:**
    - Generate video summaries of trading agent performance, backtesting results, and risk analysis reports.
    - Create video recaps of trading sessions or significant market events detected by other agents.
*   **Customizable Video Templates:**
    - Allow users to define and customize video templates for different content types (e.g., daily market updates, weekly analysis, agent performance summaries).
    - Support for adding branding elements, logos, and text overlays to videos.
*   **Automated Narration and Text-to-Speech:**
    - Integrate text-to-speech (TTS) engines to add automated voice narration to video clips, explaining market analysis or agent insights.
    - Support for different voices and languages for narration.
*   **Video Editing and Post-processing:**
    - Basic video editing features, such as trimming, merging clips, adding transitions, and background music.
    - Automated video optimization for different social media platforms (e.g., Instagram Reels, TikTok, Twitter).
*   **Data Source Integration:**
    - Seamlessly integrate with market data APIs (Binance, Coinbase, etc.) to fetch real-time and historical data for video visualizations.
    - Connect to outputs from other agents (ChartAnalysisAgent, SentimentAgent, RiskAgent) to incorporate analysis results into video content.
*   **Video Output and Management:**
    - Output generated video clips as files in specified formats.
    - Implement video file management features, including storage, organization, and version control.
    - (Future) Direct uploading to video platforms (YouTube, Vimeo, social media) via API integrations.

## AI Model(s) Used

While the current implementation does not directly utilize AI models, future versions of the Clips Agent could benefit from integrating various AI models to enhance its video creation capabilities:

*   **Large Language Models (LLMs) for Narration and Script Generation:**
    - **Content Summarization:**  LLMs (e.g., GPT-3, Bard, Claude) can be used to automatically summarize market analysis reports, agent findings, or news articles to create concise video narration scripts.
    - **Script Generation:**  LLMs can generate complete video scripts based on user-defined topics or data inputs, including intro/outro sequences, transitions, and key message delivery.
*   **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Models for Automated Voiceovers:**
    - **Realistic Voice Narration:**  Integrate TTS models (e.g., Google Cloud TTS, Amazon Polly, Microsoft Azure TTS) to convert generated scripts or text overlays into natural-sounding voiceovers for video clips.
    - **Multi-Lingual Support:**  Utilize TTS models that support multiple languages to create video content in different languages.
*   **AI-Powered Video Editing and Visual Effects:**
    - **Automated Video Editing:** AI models can be used to automate video editing tasks such as scene detection, shot selection, intelligent trimming, and adding transitions.
    - **Visual Enhancement:**  AI models can enhance video quality, apply visual effects, color correction, and stabilization.
    - **Dynamic Visual Content Generation:**  AI models could be used to generate dynamic visual elements, animations, or infographics based on market data or analysis results, enriching the visual appeal of video clips.
*   **Content Recommendation and Personalization:**
    - **Personalized Video Content:** AI models can analyze user preferences and viewing history to recommend relevant video content or personalize video clip generation.
    - **Content Tagging and Categorization:** AI models can automatically tag and categorize generated video clips for better organization and discoverability.

## Data Inputs

*   **Market Data (Future):**  To be integrated to visualize market trends in video clips.
*   **Agent Analysis Results (Future):**  To be used as content for video updates or summaries.
*   **Event Triggers (Future):**  To initiate video clip generation based on market events or agent alerts.

## Configuration Parameters

*   **agent\_id**: A unique identifier for the agent instance.
*   **agent\_type**: Must be set to `ClipsAgent`.

### Example Configuration (YAML)

```yaml
config:
  agent_id: clips_agent_01
  agent_type: ClipsAgent
```

## Example Usage

To instantiate and run the `ClipsAgent`:

```python
from src.agents.clips_agent import ClipsAgent

config = {
    "agent_id": "clips_agent_01",
    "agent_type": "ClipsAgent",
}

agent = ClipsAgent(config)
agent.run()
```

**Note:** The current implementation of `ClipsAgent` provides a basic framework. To add actual video clip generation capabilities, you would need to extend the `ClipsAgent` class and implement the following:

1.  **Video Generation Logic:** Implement code to generate video content. This might involve using libraries for video editing, charting, and data visualization.
2.  **Data Integration:** Connect the agent to relevant data sources (market data, agent outputs) to populate video content.
3.  **Content Templating:** Design templates or structures for different types of video clips (e.g., market summaries, agent performance updates).
4.  **Output Management:** Implement video file management, encoding, and potentially uploading to video platforms.

## Output and Monitoring

*   **Video Clips (Future):**  In future implementations, the agent will output generated video clips as files.
*   **Content Metadata (Future):**  Metadata associated with generated video clips (e.g., title, description, tags).
*   **Logs:**  Logs basic agent activity and any errors encountered.

## Customization Notes

*   **Extend for Specific Video Content Types:**  Customize the agent to generate specific types of video content based on your needs (e.g., daily market updates, technical analysis videos, agent performance reports).
*   **Integrate with Video Editing Libraries:**  Utilize Python video editing libraries (e.g., MoviePy, OpenCV) to implement video generation and editing logic.
*   **Automate Content Creation Workflow:**  Design a workflow to automate the entire video creation process, from data acquisition to video rendering and publishing.
*   **AI-Powered Content Enhancement:**  Explore using AI models to enhance video content, such as automated narration, background music generation, or dynamic visual effects.

## Code Location

*   `src/agents/clips_agent.py`

## Components
