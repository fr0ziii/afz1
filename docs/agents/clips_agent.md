# Clips Agent

## Description

The Clips Agent is designed for creating and managing video clips or short-form content. It provides a basic framework for agents that can automatically generate video clips based on market events, data analysis, or other triggers. This agent can be used to create engaging visual content for social media, educational purposes, or internal analysis.

## Missions

[Description of the missions this agent is designed to accomplish. Link to mission files if applicable.]
- Currently, no specific mission files are defined for the Clips Agent. Missions would be defined based on the type of video clips to be generated and the triggers for their creation.

## Configuration

The Clips Agent inherits basic configuration parameters from the `BaseAgent`. Specific configurations for video clip generation, content sources, and output formats would be defined in the agent's configuration.

-   **agent_id**: A unique identifier for the agent instance.
-   **agent_type**: Must be set to `ClipsAgent`.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
config:
  agent_id: clips_agent_01
  agent_type: ClipsAgent
  # Add any clips creation specific configurations here in the future
```

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs

-   **Market Data & Analysis Results**: Data from market analysis agents (e.g., Chart Analysis Agent, Sentiment Agent) that can be used as content for video clips.
-   **Event Triggers**: Events or conditions that trigger the creation of video clips (e.g., significant price movements, pattern detections).

### Outputs

-   **Video Clips**:  Generated video clips in specified formats (e.g., MP4).
-   **Content Metadata**: Metadata associated with the video clips (e.g., titles, descriptions, tags).
-   **Logs**: Informational and error logs for monitoring agent activity and debugging.

## Workflow

1.  **Receive Trigger**: The agent receives a trigger to create a video clip (e.g., based on a market event or scheduled time).
2.  **Gather Content**: The agent gathers relevant content for the video clip, such as chart data, analysis results, or news snippets (currently placeholder logic).
3.  **Generate Video Clip**: The agent generates a video clip using the gathered content and predefined templates or logic (currently placeholder logic).
4.  **Output Video Clip**: The agent outputs the generated video clip to a specified storage location or social media platform.
5.  **Log Creation**: The agent logs the video clip creation process and any associated metadata.

## Example Usage

To run the Clips Agent, you would instantiate and run the agent. Since the current implementation is basic, the example usage primarily involves setting up the agent and potentially adding video clip generation logic.

```python
from src.agents.clips_agent import ClipsAgent

config = {
  "agent_id": "clips_agent_01",
  "agent_type": "ClipsAgent",
}

agent = ClipsAgent(config)
# agent.run() # Run method currently placeholder
```

This example shows the basic instantiation of the Clips Agent. The `run` method is currently a placeholder and would need to be implemented with actual video clip generation logic.

## Code Location

-   `src/agents/clips_agent.py`

## Components

-   **`src/agents/base_agent.py` (BaseAgent)**: The Clips Agent inherits basic agent functionalities from the `BaseAgent`.
-   **Video Generation Components (To be implemented)**: Future implementations would include components for video editing, rendering, and content integration.
-   **Data Integration Components (Future)**: Components to integrate with data sources and analysis results from other agents.

## Notes and Considerations

-   **Placeholder Implementation**: The current `ClipsAgent` is a basic placeholder. Significant implementation is required to add actual video clip generation logic.
-   **Video Generation Logic**:  Implementing the video generation logic would involve defining templates, content integration methods, and video editing functionalities.
-   **Content Sources**:  Determine the sources of content for the video clips, such as market data APIs, analysis results, or pre-existing video/image assets.
-   **Output and Distribution**:  Define how the generated video clips will be outputted and distributed (e.g., local storage, social media platforms).
