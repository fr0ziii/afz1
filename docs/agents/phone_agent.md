# Phone Agent

## Description

The Phone Agent is designed for handling phone call interactions and notifications. It provides a basic framework for agents that can initiate phone calls, handle incoming calls, and manage phone-based notifications for critical events or alerts. This agent could be used for real-time voice alerts, interactive voice response (IVR) systems, or phone-based communication channels within the afz1 project.

## Missions

[Description of the missions this agent is designed to accomplish. Link to mission files if applicable.]
- Currently, no specific mission files are defined for the Phone Agent. Missions would be defined based on the specific phone call interactions and notification tasks it is intended to handle.

## Configuration

The Phone Agent inherits basic configuration parameters from the `BaseAgent`. Specific configurations for phone call services, notification settings, and interaction logic would be defined in the agent's configuration.

-   **agent_id**: A unique identifier for the agent instance.
-   **agent_type**: Must be set to `PhoneAgent`.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
config:
  agent_id: phone_agent_01
  agent_type: PhoneAgent
  # Add any phone call specific configurations here in the future
  # e.g., phone_service_provider, notification_numbers, voice_interaction_settings
```

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs

-   **Event Triggers**: Events or conditions that trigger phone calls or notifications (e.g., critical alerts, trading signals).
-   **Phone Call Commands**: (Future) Commands or instructions received via phone calls (e.g., through voice recognition).

### Outputs

-   **Phone Call Notifications**: Outbound phone calls to deliver voice notifications or alerts.
-   **Phone Call Interactions**: (Future) Interactive voice responses or actions taken based on phone call interactions.
-   **Logs**: Informational and error logs for monitoring agent activity and debugging.

## Workflow

1.  **Receive Trigger**: The agent receives a trigger to initiate a phone call or send a phone notification (e.g., based on a critical alert) (currently placeholder logic).
2.  **Initiate Phone Call**: The agent initiates an outbound phone call to a configured phone number using a phone call service (currently placeholder logic).
3.  **Handle Phone Interaction**: (Future) If designed for interactive calls, the agent handles voice interactions and processes voice commands.
4.  **Deliver Notification**: The agent delivers a voice notification or alert message via the phone call.
5.  **Log Activity**: The agent logs phone call activities, interactions, and notification deliveries for monitoring and analysis.

## Example Usage

To run the Phone Agent, you would instantiate and run the agent, configuring it with phone call service details and notification settings. Since the current implementation is basic, the example usage primarily involves setting up the agent and potentially adding phone call logic.

```python
from src.agents.phone_agent import PhoneAgent

config = {
  "agent_id": "phone_agent_01",
  "agent_type": "PhoneAgent",
}

agent = PhoneAgent(config)
# agent.run() # Run method currently placeholder
# Example of configuring a phone service provider (to be implemented)
# config["phone_service_provider"] = "Twilio"
# config["notification_numbers"] = ["+1234567890", "+1987654321"]
# agent = PhoneAgent(config)
# agent.send_phone_notification("Critical Alert: Market Volatility Spike") # Method to send phone notification (to be implemented)
```

This example shows the basic instantiation of the Phone Agent. The `run` method is currently a placeholder and would need to be implemented with actual phone call logic. Future implementations would include methods to configure phone services and initiate phone notifications.

## Code Location

-   `src/agents/phone_agent.py`

## Components

-   **`src/agents/base_agent.py` (BaseAgent)**: The Phone Agent inherits basic agent functionalities from the `BaseAgent`.
-   **Phone Call Service Components (To be implemented)**: Future implementations would include components for integrating with phone call service providers (e.g., Twilio, Nexmo).
-   **Voice Interaction Components (Future)**: Components for handling voice recognition, text-to-speech, and interactive voice response (IVR) logic.
-   **Alerting Components (Future)**: Components for triggering phone call alerts based on defined events or conditions.

## Notes and Considerations

-   **Placeholder Implementation**: The current `PhoneAgent` is a basic placeholder. Significant implementation is required to add actual phone call interaction capabilities.
-   **Phone Service Integration**:  Implementing phone service integration would involve handling API integrations with phone call service providers and managing API credentials.
-   **Cost Considerations**:  Phone call services often incur costs based on usage. Consider the cost implications of using phone-based notifications and interactions.
-   **User Privacy**:  Be mindful of user privacy when implementing phone-based communication. Ensure compliance with privacy regulations and secure handling of phone numbers and call logs.
-   **Reliability of Service**:  Consider the reliability and uptime of the chosen phone call service provider to ensure consistent delivery of critical alerts and notifications.
