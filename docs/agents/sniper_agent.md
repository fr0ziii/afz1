# Sniper Agent

## Description

The Sniper Agent is designed for executing sniper trading strategies, which focus on entering trades at very precise price points, often aiming to capitalize on short-term price movements or specific market conditions. It provides a basic framework for agents that can monitor market conditions, identify precise entry points based on predefined criteria, and execute trades with high precision. This agent is valuable for traders who employ strategies requiring precise trade execution and quick responses to market signals.

## Missions

[Description of the missions this agent is designed to accomplish. Link to mission files if applicable.]
- Currently, no specific mission files are defined for the Sniper Agent. Missions would be defined based on the specific sniper trading strategies, entry point criteria, and execution parameters it is intended to handle.

## Configuration

The Sniper Agent inherits basic configuration parameters from the `BaseAgent`. Specific configurations for sniper trading strategies, entry point detection methods, order execution parameters, and risk management settings would be defined in the agent's configuration.

-   **agent_id**: A unique identifier for the agent instance.
-   **agent_type**: Must be set to `SniperAgent`.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
config:
  agent_id: sniper_agent_01
  agent_type: SniperAgent
  # Add any sniper trading specific configurations here in the future
  # e.g., entry_criteria, order_parameters, risk_management_settings
```

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs

-   **Market Data**: Real-time market data, including price, order book, and potentially other indicators, for identifying sniper entry points.
-   **Trading Strategy Parameters**: Parameters defining the sniper trading strategy, entry criteria, and order execution settings.

### Outputs

-   **Executed Trades**: Trades executed at precise entry points based on the sniper trading strategy.
-   **Performance Metrics**: Metrics tracking the performance of the sniper trading strategy, including execution accuracy and profitability.
-   **Alerts**: (Optional) Alerts for identified sniper entry opportunities or trade execution confirmations.
-   **Logs**: Informational and error logs for monitoring agent activity and debugging.

## Workflow

1.  **Monitor Market Conditions**: The agent continuously monitors market data for predefined conditions that signal potential sniper entry points (currently placeholder logic).
2.  **Identify Sniper Entry Points**: Based on market conditions and strategy parameters, the agent identifies precise entry points for trades (currently placeholder logic).
3.  **Execute Trades**: The agent executes trades at the identified entry points with high precision, using specific order types and parameters (currently placeholder logic).
4.  **Monitor Trade Performance**: The agent monitors the performance of executed sniper trades, tracking metrics such as execution price and profitability.
5.  **Log Activity**: The agent logs all sniper trading activities, entry point detections, trade executions, and performance metrics for monitoring and analysis.

## Example Usage

To run the Sniper Agent, you would instantiate and run the agent, configuring it with sniper trading strategy parameters, entry criteria, and order execution settings. Since the current implementation is basic, the example usage primarily involves setting up the agent and potentially adding sniper trading logic.

```python
from src.agents.sniper_agent import SniperAgent

config = {
  "agent_id": "sniper_agent_01",
  "agent_type": "SniperAgent",
}

agent = SniperAgent(config)
# agent.run() # Run method currently placeholder
# Example of configuring sniper entry criteria (to be implemented)
# config["entry_criteria"] = {"price_level": 1.2345, "order_book_condition": "bid_size_increase"}
# config["order_parameters"] = {"order_type": "limit", "price_offset": 0.0001}
# agent = SniperAgent(config)
# agent.start_sniper_trading() # Method to initiate sniper trading (to be implemented)
```

This example shows the basic instantiation of the Sniper Agent. The `run` method is currently a placeholder and would need to be implemented with actual sniper trading logic. Future implementations would include methods to configure entry criteria, order parameters, and initiate sniper trading.

## Code Location

-   `src/agents/sniper_agent.py`

## Components

-   **`src/agents/base_agent.py` (BaseAgent)**: The Sniper Agent inherits basic agent functionalities from the `BaseAgent`.
-   **Entry Point Detection Components (To be implemented)**: Future implementations would include components for monitoring market data and identifying precise sniper entry points based on various criteria (e.g., price levels, order book conditions, technical indicators).
-   **Order Execution Components (To be implemented)**: Components for executing trades with high precision and speed, using specific order types and parameters.
-   **Risk Management Components (Future)**: Components for managing risks associated with sniper trading, such as slippage, execution failures, and market volatility.

## Notes and Considerations

-   **Placeholder Implementation**: The current `SniperAgent` is a basic placeholder. Significant implementation is required to add actual sniper trading capabilities.
-   **Entry Point Precision**:  The effectiveness of a Sniper Agent heavily relies on the precision and accuracy of entry point detection. Implementing robust and reliable entry point detection logic is crucial.
-   **Speed of Execution**:  Sniper trading often requires extremely fast order execution to capitalize on short-term opportunities. Low-latency trading infrastructure and efficient order execution mechanisms are essential.
-   **Risk Management**:  Sniper trading can be highly risky due to its focus on short-term, precise entries. Implement robust risk management strategies, including stop-loss orders and position sizing techniques.
-   **Backtesting and Optimization**:  Thoroughly backtest and optimize sniper trading strategies using historical data to evaluate their performance and refine entry criteria and order parameters.
