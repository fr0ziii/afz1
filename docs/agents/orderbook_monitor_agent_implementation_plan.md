# OrderBookMonitorAgent Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and Data Fetching**

1.  **Agent Base Structure:**
    *   Create `OrderBookMonitorAgent` class, inheriting from `src/agents/base_agent.py`.
    *   Implement basic agent lifecycle methods (`__init__`, `run`, `stop`).
    *   Define initial configuration parameters.

2.  **Configuration Management:**
    *   Implement `ConfigurationManager` within `OrderBookMonitorAgent`.
    *   Utilize `pydantic` for configuration schema definition and validation.
    *   Load configuration from environment variables or a configuration file.

3.  **Structured Logging:**
    *   Integrate `structlog` for structured logging throughout the agent.
    *   Configure JSON logging for potential integration with logging systems (e.g., ELK).

4.  **OrderBookFetcher - WebSocket Implementation:**
    *   Create `OrderBookFetcher` class in `src/components/`.
    *   Choose and integrate a suitable WebSocket library (`websockets` or `aiohttp`).
    *   Implement WebSocket connection to Binance for real-time order book stream (`depth@100ms`).
    *   Implement basic error handling and reconnection logic for WebSocket.

5.  **OrderBookFetcher - Snapshot Syncing:**
    *   Implement order book snapshot fetching using Binance REST API (`aiohttp`).
    *   Design mechanism to periodically sync snapshots to correct potential stream drift.

6.  **Basic Integration and Logging:**
    *   Instantiate `OrderBookFetcher` within `OrderBookMonitorAgent`.
    *   Log raw order book data received from the WebSocket to verify data fetching.

**Phase 2: Order Book Analysis and Large Order Detection**

1.  **OrderBookAnalyzer Implementation:**
    *   Create `OrderBookAnalyzer` class in `src/components/`.
    *   Utilize `sortedcontainers` for efficient storage and manipulation of order book data (bids/asks).
    *   Implement logic to detect large orders based on a configurable size threshold.
    *   Start with a simple static threshold for large order detection.

2.  **Integration of Analyzer and Fetcher:**
    *   Integrate `OrderBookAnalyzer` with `OrderBookFetcher` in `OrderBookMonitorAgent`.
    *   Pass fetched order book data from `OrderBookFetcher` to `OrderBookAnalyzer`.
    *   Log detected large orders with basic details (size, price, timestamp).

**Phase 3: Alert Management and Notifications (Initial)**

1.  **AlertManager Implementation (Basic):**
    *   Create `AlertManager` class in `src/components/`.
    *   Implement a basic alert dispatching mechanism, initially logging alerts to the console.
    *   Define a simple alert message format.

2.  **Integration of Alert Manager:**
    *   Integrate `AlertManager` with `OrderBookAnalyzer` in `OrderBookMonitorAgent`.
    *   Trigger alerts from `OrderBookAnalyzer` when large orders are detected.
    *   Dispatch alerts using `AlertManager` (initially to console logging).

**Phase 4: Testing, Refinement, and Advanced Features (Iterative)**

1.  **Testing and Debugging:**
    *   Implement unit tests for `OrderBookFetcher`, `OrderBookAnalyzer`, and `AlertManager`.
    *   Test WebSocket data fetching, snapshot syncing, large order detection, and basic alerting.
    *   Debug and resolve any issues identified during testing.

2.  **Refinement and Optimization:**
    *   Refine large order detection logic based on initial testing and observations.
    *   Optimize data structures and algorithms for performance.

3.  **Advanced Features (Iterative Implementation):**
    *   Implement dynamic thresholds in `OrderBookAnalyzer`.
    *   Implement Iceberg order detection in `OrderBookAnalyzer`.
    *   Integrate with notification channels (Slack/Telegram) in `AlertManager`.
    *   Implement priority queues and deduplication in `AlertManager`.
    *   Implement data persistence to InfluxDB.
    *   Implement metrics export for Grafana.
    *   Implement comprehensive testing and CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Implement security measures.
