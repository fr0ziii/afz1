# Listing Arbitrage Agent

## Description

The Listing Arbitrage Agent is designed for monitoring and analyzing listing arbitrage opportunities in cryptocurrency markets. It provides a basic framework for agents that can detect price discrepancies for newly listed tokens across different exchanges and capitalize on these discrepancies through arbitrage strategies. This agent is valuable for traders who want to take advantage of the price volatility and inefficiencies that often occur immediately after a token is listed on a new exchange.

## Missions

[Description of the missions this agent is designed to accomplish. Link to mission files if applicable.]
- Currently, no specific mission files are defined for the Listing Arbitrage Agent. Missions would be defined based on the specific arbitrage strategies and listing detection methods it is intended to handle.

## Configuration

The Listing Arbitrage Agent inherits basic configuration parameters from the `BaseAgent`. Specific configurations for arbitrage strategies, exchange connections, listing monitoring sources, and trading pairs would be defined in the agent's configuration.

-   **agent_id**: A unique identifier for the agent instance.
-   **agent_type**: Must be set to `ListingArbAgent`.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
config:
  agent_id: listingarb_agent_01
  agent_type: ListingArbAgent
  # Add any listing arbitrage monitoring specific configurations here in the future
  # e.g., exchanges, listing_sources, arbitrage_pairs, price_deviation_threshold, trade_size
```

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs

-   **Listing Data**: Information about new cryptocurrency listings from various sources (e.g., exchange APIs, news feeds, social media).
-   **Price Data**: Real-time price data from multiple exchanges for the newly listed tokens.
-   **Exchange Account Information**: API keys and account details for connected exchanges.

### Outputs

-   **Arbitrage Trades**: Trades executed to capitalize on listing arbitrage opportunities.
-   **Profit/Loss Tracking**: Metrics tracking the profit and loss from arbitrage trades.
-   **Alerts**: Alerts for identified listing arbitrage opportunities or execution issues.
-   **Logs**: Informational and error logs for monitoring agent activity and debugging.

## Workflow

1.  **Monitor Listing Sources**: The agent monitors various sources for announcements of new cryptocurrency listings (currently placeholder logic).
2.  **Detect Price Discrepancies**: Upon detecting a new listing, the agent fetches price data from multiple exchanges and identifies price discrepancies for the newly listed token (currently placeholder logic).
3.  **Execute Arbitrage Trades**: When a price discrepancy is identified, the agent executes arbitrage trades on the relevant exchanges to capitalize on the price difference (currently placeholder logic).
4.  **Track Performance**: The agent tracks the performance of arbitrage trades, including profit and loss.
5.  **Log Activity**: The agent logs all arbitrage activities, listing detections, trade executions, and performance metrics for monitoring and analysis.

## Example Usage

To run the Listing Arbitrage Agent, you would instantiate and run the agent, configuring it with exchange connections, listing sources, and arbitrage strategy parameters. Since the current implementation is basic, the example usage primarily involves setting up the agent and potentially adding arbitrage logic.

```python
from src.agents.listingarb_agent import ListingArbAgent

config = {
  "agent_id": "listingarb_agent_01",
  "agent_type": "ListingArbAgent",
}

agent = ListingArbAgent(config)
# agent.run() # Run method currently placeholder
# Example of configuring exchanges and listing sources (to be implemented)
# config["exchanges"] = ["ExchangeA", "ExchangeB"]
# config["listing_sources"] = ["Twitter", "ExchangeAPIs"]
# agent = ListingArbAgent(config)
# agent.start_listing_arbitrage() # Method to initiate listing arbitrage monitoring (to be implemented)
```

This example shows the basic instantiation of the Listing Arbitrage Agent. The `run` method is currently a placeholder and would need to be implemented with actual listing arbitrage logic. Future implementations would include methods to configure exchanges, listing sources, and initiate monitoring.

## Code Location

-   `src/agents/listingarb_agent.py`

## Components

-   **`src/agents/base_agent.py` (BaseAgent)**: The Listing Arbitrage Agent inherits basic agent functionalities from the `BaseAgent`.
-   **Listing Data Components (To be implemented)**: Future implementations would include components for monitoring various listing sources (e.g., APIs, web scraping, news feeds).
-   **Exchange Integration Components (To be implemented)**: Components for connecting to and interacting with multiple cryptocurrency exchanges for order placement and data retrieval.
-   **Arbitrage Strategy Components (Future)**: Components implementing specific listing arbitrage strategies and logic for opportunity detection and trade execution.
-   **Risk Management Components (Future)**: Components for managing risks associated with arbitrage trading, such as execution failures and rapid price changes.

## Notes and Considerations

-   **Placeholder Implementation**: The current `ListingArbAgent` is a basic placeholder. Significant implementation is required to add actual listing arbitrage trading capabilities.
-   **Listing Source Integration**:  Implementing listing source integration would involve handling APIs, web scraping, and parsing data from various sources to detect new listings.
-   **Speed of Execution**:  Listing arbitrage opportunities are often short-lived. High-speed data processing and trade execution are crucial for successful listing arbitrage.
-   **Risk Management**:  Listing arbitrage is inherently risky due to price volatility and potential for failed executions. Robust risk management is essential.
-   **Monitoring and Alerting**:  Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting to track listing events, arbitrage opportunities, trade executions, and potential issues.
