# Sentiment Agent (`sentiment_agent.py`)

## Purpose

The Sentiment Agent is designed to analyze market sentiment from various text-based sources, such as social media, news articles, and financial blogs. By processing and interpreting textual data, this agent aims to provide sentiment scores or indicators that reflect the overall market mood and investor sentiment towards cryptocurrencies. This information can be valuable for traders and analysts incorporating sentiment analysis into their decision-making processes.

## Functionality

*   **Abstract Base Class for Sentiment Analysis:** The current `SentimentAgent` is an abstract base class, defining the interface and common functionalities for sentiment analysis agents.
*   **Data Source Integration (To be implemented in subclasses):** Concrete subclasses will integrate with various text-based data sources for sentiment analysis, such as:
    *   **Twitter/X API:**  Fetching tweets related to cryptocurrencies for social media sentiment analysis.
    *   **News APIs:**  Accessing news articles from financial news sources.
    *   **RSS Feeds:**  Subscribing to RSS feeds from financial blogs or news sites.
    *   **Web Scraping (Potentially):**  Scraping data from websites (with appropriate ethical considerations and terms of service compliance).
*   **Text Preprocessing (To be implemented in subclasses):** Concrete subclasses will implement text preprocessing steps to clean and prepare text data for sentiment analysis, including:
    *   **Tokenization:**  Breaking text into individual words or tokens.
    *   **Stop Word Removal:**  Removing common words that don't carry significant sentiment.
    *   **Stemming/Lemmatization:**  Reducing words to their root form.
    *   **Noise Removal:**  Handling special characters, URLs, and other noise in text data.
*   **Sentiment Scoring (To be implemented in subclasses):** Concrete subclasses will implement sentiment scoring mechanisms using various techniques, such as:
    *   **Lexicon-Based Sentiment Analysis:**  Using sentiment lexicons (e.g., VADER, TextBlob) to assign sentiment scores based on word polarity.
    *   **Machine Learning-Based Sentiment Analysis:**  Integrating pre-trained or custom-trained machine learning models (e.g., sentiment classifiers) for more advanced sentiment analysis.
    *   **Hybrid Approaches:**  Combining lexicon-based and machine learning methods for improved accuracy.
*   **Sentiment Aggregation (To be implemented in subclasses):**  Concrete subclasses may aggregate sentiment scores from multiple sources or across different timeframes to provide an overall market sentiment indicator.
*   **Sentiment Alerting (To be implemented in subclasses):**  Future subclasses may implement alerting mechanisms based on sentiment scores, such as:
    *   **Extreme Sentiment Alerts:**  Alerts when sentiment scores reach extreme positive or negative levels.
    *   **Sentiment Shift Alerts:**  Alerts for significant changes or shifts in sentiment over time.
    *   **Divergence Alerts:**  Alerts for divergence between sentiment indicators and price movements.
*   **Sentiment Reporting (To be implemented in subclasses):**  Concrete subclasses will generate sentiment reports with sentiment scores, analysis summaries, and visualizations.

## AI Model(s) Used

*   None directly in the base class.
*   AI models will be integrated in concrete subclasses for machine learning-based sentiment analysis. Potential models include:
    *   **Pre-trained Sentiment Analysis Models:**  Utilizing pre-trained models from libraries like Hugging Face Transformers for sentiment classification.
    *   **Custom-Trained Models:**  Training custom sentiment analysis models on financial text data for domain-specific sentiment analysis.

## Data Inputs

*   **Text Data Sources (To be configured in subclasses):**  Configuration for various text data sources, such as Twitter API credentials, news API keys, RSS feed URLs, etc.
*   **Cryptocurrency Keywords (To be configured in subclasses):**  Keywords or hashtags related to specific cryptocurrencies for filtering relevant text data.

## Configuration Parameters

*   **agent\_id**: A unique identifier for the agent instance.
*   **agent\_type**: Must be set to `SentimentAgent`.
*   **Sentiment-Specific Configuration (To be defined in subclasses):** Concrete subclasses will define their own configuration parameters for data sources, sentiment analysis techniques, and alerting thresholds.

### Example Configuration (YAML - Base Class)

```yaml
config:
  agent_id: sentiment_agent_base_01
  agent_type: SentimentAgent
```

**Note:** This configuration is for the abstract base class. Concrete subclasses of `SentimentAgent` will require their own specific configurations for data sources and sentiment analysis parameters.

## Example Usage

To use the `SentimentAgent`, you would typically create a subclass that implements specific sentiment analysis logic and then instantiate and run the subclassed agent. The base `SentimentAgent` class itself is abstract and not meant to be run directly.

```python
# Example of how a concrete subclass might be implemented (conceptual)
from src.agents.sentiment_agent import SentimentAgent

class TwitterSentimentAgent(SentimentAgent):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__(config)
        # Load Twitter API credentials and configuration
        self.twitter_api_key = config.get("twitter_api_key")
        self.cryptocurrency_keywords = config.get("cryptocurrency_keywords", ["bitcoin", "ethereum"])

    def run(self):
        # Implement Twitter data fetching, sentiment analysis, and alerting logic here
        tweets = self.fetch_tweets_from_twitter() # Example method
        sentiment_scores = self.analyze_sentiment_of_tweets(tweets) # Example method
        overall_sentiment = self.aggregate_sentiment_scores(sentiment_scores) # Example method

        if overall_sentiment < -0.5: # Example negative sentiment threshold
            self._log_warning(f"Negative sentiment detected on Twitter: {overall_sentiment}")
            # Implement alerting actions (e.g., send alert)

        self._log_info("Sentiment analysis cycle completed")


# Example configuration for the concrete subclass
config = {
    "agent_id": "twitter_sentiment_agent_01",
    "agent_type": "TwitterSentimentAgent", # Assuming TwitterSentimentAgent is the subclass name
    "twitter_api_key": "YOUR_TWITTER_API_KEY",
    "cryptocurrency_keywords": ["bitcoin", "ethereum", "XRP"]
}

agent = TwitterSentimentAgent(config)
agent.run()
```

**Note:** The `TwitterSentimentAgent` example above is conceptual and would require further implementation of data fetching, sentiment analysis, and alerting methods.

## Output and Monitoring

*   **Sentiment Scores (Output by subclasses):** Concrete subclasses will output sentiment scores for different sources or aggregated sentiment indicators.
*   **Sentiment Analysis Reports (Output by subclasses):** Subclasses will generate sentiment analysis reports with detailed sentiment breakdowns and visualizations.
*   **Sentiment Alerts (Output by subclasses):** Subclasses will trigger alerts based on sentiment levels or shifts.
*   **Logs:**  Logs basic agent activity and configuration loading from the base class. Subclasses should extend logging for their specific functionalities and data sources.

## Customization Notes

*   **Create Concrete Subclasses for Data Sources:**  To implement sentiment analysis for specific data sources, you need to create concrete subclasses of `SentimentAgent` for each source (e.g., `TwitterSentimentAgent`, `NewsSentimentAgent`).
*   **Implement Data Source Integration:**  Within subclasses, implement methods to connect to and fetch data from the chosen text data sources (APIs, RSS feeds, etc.).
*   **Choose and Implement Sentiment Analysis Techniques:**  Select appropriate sentiment analysis techniques (lexicon-based, machine learning) and implement them within subclasses.
*   **Define Sentiment Thresholds and Alerts:**  Configure sentiment thresholds and implement alerting mechanisms within subclasses to notify users of significant sentiment events.
*   **AI-Powered Sentiment Analysis in Subclasses:**  Incorporate AI models within subclasses to enhance sentiment analysis accuracy, handle nuanced language, and potentially perform more advanced natural language understanding tasks.

## Code Location

*   `src/agents/sentiment_agent.py`

## Components

*   **BaseAgent (`src/agents/base_agent.py`):**  The `SentimentAgent` class inherits from `BaseAgent`, providing the basic agent lifecycle methods and configuration loading.

## Next Steps for Development

*   **Develop Concrete Sentiment Agent Subclasses:** Create example subclasses of `SentimentAgent` that implement sentiment analysis for specific data sources (e.g., `TwitterSentimentAgent`, `NewsSentimentAgent`).
*   **Implement Data Fetching for Subclasses:** Within subclasses, implement methods to fetch text data from chosen sources (Twitter API, news APIs, etc.).
*   **Integrate Sentiment Analysis Libraries:**  Incorporate sentiment analysis libraries (e.g., VADER, TextBlob, Hugging Face Transformers) into subclasses to perform sentiment scoring.
*   **Add Sentiment Alerting Features:** Implement basic alerting features based on sentiment scores within subclasses.
*   **User Interface for Sentiment Configuration (for subclasses):**  Develop user interface elements to configure data sources and sentiment parameters for concrete sentiment agent subclasses.
