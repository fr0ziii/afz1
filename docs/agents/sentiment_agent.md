# Sentiment Agent

## Description

The Sentiment Agent is designed for analyzing market sentiment from various sources, such as social media, news articles, and other text-based data. It provides a foundational framework for agents that can gather data from sentiment sources, process and analyze the text to determine market sentiment, and provide sentiment scores or indicators. This agent can be used to incorporate sentiment analysis into trading strategies, risk assessment, or market monitoring.

## Missions

[Description of the missions this agent is designed to accomplish. Link to mission files if applicable.]
- Currently, no specific mission files are defined for the Sentiment Agent. Missions would be defined based on the specific sentiment analysis tasks, data sources to be used, and sentiment indicators to be generated.

## Configuration

The Sentiment Agent inherits basic configuration parameters from the `BaseAgent`. Subclasses are expected to override the `load_config` method to implement sentiment-specific configuration loading and validation. Specific configurations for sentiment data sources, NLP models, and sentiment scoring methods would be defined in the agent's configuration.

-   **agent_id**: A unique identifier for the agent instance.
-   **agent_type**: Must be set to `SentimentAgent`.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
config:
  agent_id: sentiment_agent_01
  agent_type: SentimentAgent
  # Add any sentiment analysis specific configurations here in the future
  # e.g., sentiment_data_sources, nlp_model, sentiment_scoring_method
```

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs

-   **Sentiment Data Sources**: Data streams or APIs providing text-based data for sentiment analysis (e.g., social media feeds, news APIs).
-   **Configuration Parameters**: Configuration settings defining data sources, NLP models, and sentiment scoring methods.

### Outputs

-   **Sentiment Scores**:  Numerical sentiment scores or indicators representing the overall market sentiment.
-   **Sentiment Analysis Reports**:  Reports summarizing sentiment analysis results, trends, and key sentiment drivers.
-   **Sentiment Alerts**:  Alerts triggered when sentiment reaches extreme levels or significant changes are detected.
-   **Logs**: Informational and error logs for monitoring agent activity and debugging.

## Workflow

1.  **Load Configuration**: The agent loads and validates sentiment-specific configuration parameters, potentially overriding the base `load_config` method.
2.  **Setup Dependencies**: The agent sets up sentiment-specific dependencies, such as API clients for data sources or NLP libraries, by overriding the `setup_dependencies` method.
3.  **Fetch Sentiment Data**: The agent fetches text-based data from configured sentiment data sources (currently placeholder logic in the base class, expected to be implemented in subclasses).
4.  **Analyze Sentiment**: The agent analyzes the fetched text data using NLP models and sentiment scoring methods to determine market sentiment (currently placeholder logic).
5.  **Generate Sentiment Scores and Reports**: The agent generates sentiment scores and reports summarizing the sentiment analysis results (currently placeholder logic).
6.  **Trigger Sentiment Alerts**: The agent triggers alerts based on predefined sentiment thresholds or significant sentiment changes (currently placeholder logic).
7.  **Log Activity**: The agent logs sentiment analysis activities, sentiment scores, generated reports and alerts, and any data processing steps for monitoring and analysis.

## Example Usage

To run the Sentiment Agent, you would typically create a subclass of `SentimentAgent` to implement specific sentiment analysis logic and then instantiate and run the subclassed agent. The base `SentimentAgent` class is abstract and requires subclassing to be functional.

```python
from src.agents.sentiment_agent import SentimentAgent

class MySentimentAgent(SentimentAgent): # Example subclass implementing specific sentiment logic
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__(config)

    def load_config(self, config: dict) -> dict:
        config = super().load_config(config)
        # Load and validate sentiment-specific configurations here
        # Example: data_source_api_key = config.get("data_source_api_key")
        return config

    def setup_dependencies(self):
        super().setup_dependencies()
        # Initialize sentiment-specific dependencies here, e.g., NLP models, API clients

    def run(self):
        super().run()
        # Implement sentiment analysis logic here, e.g., analyze_social_media_sentiment()

config = {
  "agent_id": "my_sentiment_agent_01",
  "agent_type": "MySentimentAgent", # Use the subclass name here
  # Add sentiment-specific configurations here
}

agent = MySentimentAgent(config) # Instantiate the subclassed agent
# agent.run() # Run method to execute sentiment analysis logic (to be implemented in subclass)
```

This example shows how to create a subclass `MySentimentAgent` that extends the base `SentimentAgent` to implement custom sentiment analysis logic. The `run` method in the subclass would contain the specific sentiment data fetching and analysis logic.

## Code Location

-   `src/agents/sentiment_agent.py`

## Components

-   **`src/agents/base_agent.py` (BaseAgent)**: The Sentiment Agent inherits basic agent functionalities from the `BaseAgent`.
-   **Sentiment Data Source Components (To be implemented in subclasses)**: Subclasses would implement components for connecting to and fetching data from various sentiment data sources (e.g., social media APIs, news APIs).
-   **NLP Models (To be implemented in subclasses)**: Subclasses would integrate and utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for text analysis and sentiment scoring.
-   **Sentiment Scoring Components (To be implemented in subclasses)**: Subclasses would implement logic for calculating and aggregating sentiment scores from NLP analysis.
-   **Reporting and Alerting Components (Future)**: Components for generating sentiment reports and triggering alerts based on sentiment levels or changes.

## Notes and Considerations

-   **Abstract Base Class**: The `SentimentAgent` is designed as an abstract base class. It needs to be subclassed to implement concrete sentiment analysis strategies.
-   **Subclass Implementation**:  Significant implementation is required in subclasses to add specific data source integrations, NLP models, and sentiment scoring logic.
-   **Data Source Selection**:  Carefully select relevant and reliable sentiment data sources for market sentiment analysis.
-   **NLP Model Choice**:  Choose appropriate NLP models and techniques for sentiment analysis in the financial domain, considering the nuances of financial text and language.
-   **Sentiment Scoring Methodology**:  Define a robust and meaningful sentiment scoring methodology that accurately reflects market sentiment and can be used for trading or risk management decisions.
-   **Real-time Analysis**:  For timely sentiment analysis, implement real-time data processing and analysis pipelines to capture and react to market sentiment changes promptly.
