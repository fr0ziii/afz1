# Solana Agent

## Description

The Solana Agent is designed for monitoring and analyzing Solana-specific data and events on the Solana blockchain. It provides a basic framework for agents that can track Solana network activity, monitor Solana tokens, and analyze Solana-specific metrics or events. This agent can be valuable for users interested in Solana ecosystem-specific opportunities, monitoring Solana-based assets, or participating in the Solana network.

## Missions

[Description of the missions this agent is designed to accomplish. Link to mission files if applicable.]
- Currently, no specific mission files are defined for the Solana Agent. Missions would be defined based on the specific Solana-related monitoring tasks, data points to be tracked, and Solana ecosystem events it is intended to handle.

## Configuration

The Solana Agent inherits basic configuration parameters from the `BaseAgent`. Specific configurations for Solana data sources, Solana network connections, and Solana-specific monitoring parameters would be defined in the agent's configuration.

-   **agent_id**: A unique identifier for the agent instance.
-   **agent_type**: Must be set to `SolanaAgent`.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
config:
  agent_id: solana_agent_01
  agent_type: SolanaAgent
  # Add any Solana specific configurations here in the future
  # e.g., solana_rpc_url, monitored_tokens, event_types
```

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs

-   **Solana Blockchain Data**: Real-time or historical data from the Solana blockchain, accessed through Solana APIs or RPC URLs.
-   **Solana Network Events**: Data streams or APIs providing information about events on the Solana network (e.g., new token listings, transaction activity).
-   **Configuration Parameters**: Configuration settings defining Solana network connections, monitored tokens, and event types.

### Outputs

-   **Solana Network Alerts**: Alerts for specific events or conditions detected on the Solana network (e.g., large transactions, new token listings).
-   **Solana Data Analysis**:  Analysis of Solana-specific data, potentially including token performance analysis, network activity metrics, and visualizations (future implementation).
-   **Logs**: Informational and error logs for monitoring agent activity and debugging.

## Workflow

1.  **Connect to Solana Network**: The agent connects to the Solana network using configured RPC URLs or APIs (currently placeholder logic).
2.  **Monitor Solana Data**: The agent monitors Solana blockchain data and network events based on configured parameters (currently placeholder logic).
3.  **Analyze Solana Data**: The agent analyzes Solana-specific data to identify relevant events, trends, or conditions (currently placeholder logic).
4.  **Generate Alerts**: The agent generates alerts for specific Solana network events or conditions that meet predefined criteria (currently placeholder logic).
5.  **Output Analysis**:  In future implementations, the agent can output more detailed analysis of Solana-specific data.
6.  **Log Activity**: The agent logs Solana monitoring activities, analysis results, and generated alerts for monitoring and analysis.

## Example Usage

To run the Solana Agent, you would instantiate and run the agent, configuring it with Solana network connection details and monitoring parameters. Since the current implementation is basic, the example usage primarily involves setting up the agent and potentially adding Solana monitoring logic.

```python
from src.agents.solana_agent import SolanaAgent

config = {
  "agent_id": "solana_agent_01",
  "agent_type": "SolanaAgent",
}

agent = SolanaAgent(config)
# agent.run() # Run method currently placeholder
# Example of configuring Solana RPC URL and monitored tokens (to be implemented)
# config["solana_rpc_url"] = "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
# config["monitored_tokens"] = ["SOL", "RAY", "SRM"]
# agent = SolanaAgent(config)
# agent.start_solana_monitoring() # Method to initiate Solana monitoring (to be implemented)
```

This example shows the basic instantiation of the Solana Agent. The `run` method is currently a placeholder and would need to be implemented with actual Solana monitoring logic. Future implementations would include methods to configure Solana network connections and initiate monitoring.

## Code Location

-   `src/agents/solana_agent.py`

## Components

-   **`src/agents/base_agent.py` (BaseAgent)**: The Solana Agent inherits basic agent functionalities from the `BaseAgent`.
-   **Solana Data Components (To be implemented)**: Future implementations would include components for connecting to Solana networks, accessing Solana blockchain data, and subscribing to Solana network events (e.g., using Solana Web3.js or similar libraries).
-   **Solana Analysis Components (Future)**: Components for analyzing Solana-specific data, such as token performance, transaction trends, and network activity metrics.
-   **Alerting Components (Future)**: Components for generating and delivering alerts based on Solana network events or data analysis results.

## Notes and Considerations

-   **Placeholder Implementation**: The current `SolanaAgent` is a basic placeholder. Significant implementation is required to add actual Solana monitoring capabilities.
-   **Solana Network Integration**:  Implementing Solana network integration would involve using Solana SDKs or APIs to connect to Solana nodes and access blockchain data.
-   **Data Source Selection**:  Identify relevant and reliable Solana data sources for the specific monitoring tasks and analysis goals.
-   **Solana Ecosystem Knowledge**:  Effective use of the Solana Agent may require specific knowledge of the Solana ecosystem, Solana tokens, and Solana network events.
-   **Scalability**:  Consider the scalability of Solana data access and processing, especially when monitoring large volumes of Solana network data or high-frequency events.
