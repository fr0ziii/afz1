# Liquidation Agent

## Description

The Liquidation Agent is designed for monitoring and analyzing liquidation events in cryptocurrency markets. It provides a basic framework for agents that can track liquidations, identify significant liquidation levels, and potentially generate signals based on liquidation data. This agent can be valuable for traders looking to understand market volatility and potential price movements driven by liquidations.

## Missions

[Description of the missions this agent is designed to accomplish. Link to mission files if applicable.]
- Currently, no specific mission files are defined for the Liquidation Agent. Missions would be defined based on the specific liquidation analysis tasks and signal generation strategies it is intended to handle.

## Configuration

The Liquidation Agent inherits basic configuration parameters from the `BaseAgent`. Specific configurations for liquidation data sources, trading pairs, and analysis parameters would be defined in the agent's configuration.

-   **agent_id**: A unique identifier for the agent instance.
-   **agent_type**: Must be set to `LiquidationAgent`.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
config:
  agent_id: liquidation_agent_01
  agent_type: LiquidationAgent
  # Add any liquidation monitoring specific configurations here in the future
  # e.g., exchange, trading_pairs, liquidation_thresholds
```

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs

-   **Liquidation Data**: Real-time or historical liquidation data from cryptocurrency exchanges.
-   **Trading Pair Information**:  List of trading pairs for which liquidation events should be monitored.

### Outputs

-   **Liquidation Alerts**: Alerts triggered when significant liquidation events are detected.
-   **Liquidation Analysis**:  Analysis of liquidation data, potentially including volume analysis, price impact assessment, and visualizations (future implementation).
-   **Logs**: Informational and error logs for monitoring agent activity and debugging.

## Workflow

1.  **Fetch Liquidation Data**: The agent fetches liquidation data for configured trading pairs from cryptocurrency exchanges (currently placeholder logic).
2.  **Analyze Liquidations**: The agent analyzes the fetched liquidation data, looking for significant events or patterns based on configured parameters (currently placeholder logic).
3.  **Generate Alerts**: The agent generates alerts when significant liquidation events are detected based on predefined criteria (currently placeholder logic).
4.  **Output Analysis**:  In future implementations, the agent can output more detailed analysis of liquidation data.
5.  **Log Activity**: The agent logs liquidation monitoring activities, analysis results, and generated alerts for monitoring and analysis.

## Example Usage

To run the Liquidation Agent, you would instantiate and run the agent, configuring it with data sources and trading pairs to monitor. Since the current implementation is basic, the example usage primarily involves setting up the agent and potentially adding liquidation monitoring logic.

```python
from src.agents.liquidation_agent import LiquidationAgent

config = {
  "agent_id": "liquidation_agent_01",
  "agent_type": "LiquidationAgent",
}

agent = LiquidationAgent(config)
# agent.run() # Run method currently placeholder
# Example of configuring trading pairs to monitor (to be implemented)
# config["trading_pairs"] = ["BTC/USDT", "ETH/USDT"]
# agent = LiquidationAgent(config)
# agent.start_monitoring_liquidations() # Method to initiate liquidation monitoring (to be implemented)
```

This example shows the basic instantiation of the Liquidation Agent. The `run` method is currently a placeholder and would need to be implemented with actual liquidation monitoring logic. Future implementations would include methods to configure trading pairs and initiate monitoring.

## Code Location

-   `src/agents/liquidation_agent.py`

## Components

-   **`src/agents/base_agent.py` (BaseAgent)**: The Liquidation Agent inherits basic agent functionalities from the `BaseAgent`.
-   **Liquidation Data Components (To be implemented)**: Future implementations would include components for fetching liquidation data from various cryptocurrency exchanges (e.g., API integrations).
-   **Liquidation Analysis Components (Future)**: Components for analyzing liquidation data, detecting significant events, and generating insights.
-   **Alerting Components (Future)**: Components for generating and delivering alerts based on liquidation events.

## Notes and Considerations

-   **Placeholder Implementation**: The current `LiquidationAgent` is a basic placeholder. Significant implementation is required to add actual liquidation monitoring capabilities.
-   **Data Source Integration**:  Implementing data source integration would involve defining APIs to fetch liquidation data from different exchanges or data providers.
-   **Analysis Logic**:  Define the logic for analyzing liquidations and generating meaningful signals or alerts based on liquidation events.
-   **Alerting Mechanisms**:  Implement alerting mechanisms to notify users when significant liquidation events are detected (e.g., email, push notifications).
-   **Data Accuracy**:  Ensure the accuracy and reliability of liquidation data sources, as inaccurate data can lead to incorrect analysis and signals.
