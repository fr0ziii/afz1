# Liquidation Agent (`liquidation_agent.py`)

## Purpose

The Liquidation Agent is designed to continuously monitor and analyze liquidation events occurring in cryptocurrency markets. By tracking and analyzing liquidations, which represent forced closures of leveraged positions, this agent aims to provide valuable insights into:

*   **Market Volatility Assessment:**  Liquidation events are often indicative of high market volatility. The agent helps quantify and track market volatility by monitoring liquidation volumes and frequency.
*   **Potential Price Movement Prediction:**  Large liquidation cascades can trigger significant price movements. By detecting and analyzing liquidation events, the agent can provide early warnings of potential price drops or volatility spikes.
*   **Risk Level Indication:**  High liquidation volumes and sudden liquidation spikes can signal increased risk levels in the market, prompting traders to adjust their risk management strategies.
*   **Market Anomaly Detection:**  Unusual liquidation patterns or spikes can indicate market anomalies, potential manipulation, or systemic risks that traders and analysts need to be aware of.
*   **Trading Strategy Development:**  Liquidation data can be used to develop and refine trading strategies, particularly volatility-based strategies or strategies that capitalize on market imbalances caused by liquidations (although the agent itself does not implement trading strategies).

By providing real-time and historical liquidation data and analysis, the Liquidation Agent empowers users to better understand market dynamics, assess risk levels, and potentially anticipate price volatility in cryptocurrency markets.

## Functionality

The Liquidation Agent is envisioned to offer a range of functionalities for comprehensive liquidation monitoring and analysis:

*   **Real-time Liquidation Data Aggregation:**
    - Continuously collect and aggregate liquidation data from multiple cryptocurrency exchanges, providing a comprehensive view of liquidation events across the market.
    - Integrate with exchange APIs or data providers that offer real-time liquidation feeds.
*   **Versatile Liquidation Event Analysis:**
    - **Liquidation Volume Tracking:**  Monitor and track the total volume of liquidations across different timeframes (e.g., hourly, daily), providing insights into overall market liquidation activity.
    - **Price Impact Assessment:**  Analyze the price impact of liquidation events by correlating liquidation data with price charts and order book data, quantifying the effect of liquidations on price movements.
    - **Liquidation Heatmaps and Visualizations:**  Generate interactive heatmaps and visualizations to display liquidation concentrations across different price levels, trading pairs, or exchanges, allowing users to visually identify key liquidation zones.
    - **Liquidation Type Classification:** (Future) Classify liquidation events by type (e.g., long vs. short liquidations) to provide more granular insights into market imbalances.
*   **Customizable Volatility and Anomaly Alerting:**
    - **High Liquidation Volume Alerts:**  Configure alerts to trigger when total liquidation volumes exceed user-defined thresholds, signaling potential increases in market volatility.
    - **Sudden Liquidation Spike Detection:**  Implement algorithms to detect sudden spikes or surges in liquidation activity, potentially indicating rapid market shifts or cascading liquidations.
    - **Trading Pair-Specific Alerts:**  Set up alerts for significant liquidation events or unusual activity in specific trading pairs of interest.
    - **Alert Delivery Methods:**  Support various alert delivery methods, such as console alerts, email notifications, or webhook integrations.
*   **Historical Liquidation Data Analysis and Backtesting:**
    - **Historical Data Storage:**  Store historical liquidation data in a structured database for in-depth analysis and backtesting purposes.
    - **Trend and Pattern Identification:**  Implement tools for analyzing historical liquidation data to identify trends, cyclical patterns, or correlations with other market indicators.
    - **Backtesting of Liquidation-Based Strategies:**  (Future) Allow users to backtest trading strategies that incorporate liquidation data as signals or indicators, evaluating the effectiveness of liquidation-based trading approaches.

## AI Model(s) Used

Future implementations of the Liquidation Agent could leverage AI models to enhance its analytical and predictive capabilities:

*   **Liquidation Event Prediction:**
    - **Machine Learning Classifiers:**  Utilize machine learning classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks) trained on historical market data, order book features, and liquidation events to predict potential future liquidations.
    - **Anomaly Detection for Pre-Liquidation Signals:**  Employ anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual patterns in order book data or market activity that may precede large liquidation events, providing early warning signals.
*   **Volatility Forecasting and Market Regime Detection:**
    - **Volatility Prediction Models:**  Use time series forecasting models (e.g., GARCH, LSTM) trained on liquidation data and other market indicators to improve volatility forecasting accuracy, enabling better risk management and strategy adjustments.
    - **Market Regime Classification:**  Employ machine learning models to classify market regimes (e.g., high volatility, low volatility, trending, ranging) based on liquidation patterns and market dynamics, allowing for regime-specific trading strategy adjustments.
*   **AI-Powered Risk Assessment and Management:**
    - **Liquidation Risk Scoring:**  Develop AI-driven risk scoring models that assess the liquidation risk for specific trading pairs or the overall market based on real-time liquidation data and market conditions.
    - **Dynamic Risk Threshold Adjustment:**  Use machine learning to dynamically adjust risk thresholds and alerting parameters based on AI-predicted volatility and liquidation risk levels, enabling adaptive risk management.
*   **Market Manipulation and Anomaly Detection:**
    - **Manipulation Pattern Recognition:**  Employ AI-powered pattern recognition techniques to identify unusual or suspicious liquidation patterns that may indicate market manipulation or wash trading activities.
    - **Anomaly Alerting for Unusual Liquidations:**  Develop anomaly detection algorithms to trigger alerts for statistically significant deviations in liquidation patterns, potentially signaling market irregularities or security threats.

## Data Inputs

The Liquidation Agent relies on the following data inputs for effective liquidation monitoring and analysis:

*   **Real-time Liquidation Data Feeds:**
    - Continuous data streams providing real-time liquidation events from cryptocurrency exchanges.
    - Data should include: Exchange name, trading pair symbol, liquidation price, liquidation quantity, order side (buy or sell), and timestamp.
    - Data sources: Cryptocurrency exchange APIs (e.g., Binance Futures API, Bybit API, Kraken Futures API).
*   **Historical Liquidation Data:**
    - Historical datasets of liquidation events for backtesting, trend analysis, and model training.
    - Data sources: Cryptocurrency exchange APIs (historical data endpoints), specialized data providers that aggregate and archive liquidation data.
*   **Trading Pair and Exchange Configuration:**
    - User-defined lists of trading pairs and exchanges to monitor for liquidation events.
    - Configuration settings to specify data sources, API endpoints, and data update frequencies.
*   **Market Data Context (Optional):**
    - Real-time market data feeds (price data, order book data, volume data) to correlate liquidation events with broader market conditions and price movements.
    - Used for price impact assessment, volatility analysis, and identifying relationships between liquidations and market dynamics.

## Configuration Parameters

*   **agent\_id**: A unique identifier for the agent instance.
*   **agent\_type**: Must be set to `LiquidationAgent`.

### Example Configuration (YAML)

```yaml
config:
  agent_id: liquidation_agent_01
  agent_type: LiquidationAgent
```

## Example Usage

To instantiate and run the `LiquidationAgent`:

```python
from src.agents.liquidation_agent import LiquidationAgent

config = {
    "agent_id": "liquidation_agent_01",

}

agent = LiquidationAgent(config)
agent.run()
```

**Note:** The current implementation of `LiquidationAgent` provides a basic framework. To add actual liquidation monitoring and analysis capabilities, you would need to extend the `LiquidationAgent` class and implement the following:
