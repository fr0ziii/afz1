# RBI Agent (Risk-Based Investing)

## Description

The RBI Agent, or Risk-Based Investing Agent, is designed for implementing risk-based investment strategies in cryptocurrency trading. It provides a basic framework for agents that can adjust investment decisions based on risk assessments and predefined risk parameters. This agent can be used to manage portfolio risk, optimize risk-adjusted returns, or implement strategies that dynamically allocate capital based on market risk conditions.

## Missions

[Description of the missions this agent is designed to accomplish. Link to mission files if applicable.]
- Currently, no specific mission files are defined for the RBI Agent. Missions would be defined based on the specific risk-based investment strategies and risk assessment methods it is intended to handle.

## Configuration

The RBI Agent inherits basic configuration parameters from the `BaseAgent`. Specific configurations for risk assessment models, risk parameters, and investment strategies would be defined in the agent's configuration.

-   **agent_id**: A unique identifier for the agent instance.
-   **agent_type**: Must be set to `RbiAgent`.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
config:
  agent_id: rbi_agent_01
  agent_type: RbiAgent
  # Add any RBI specific configurations here in the future
  # e.g., risk_model, risk_parameters, investment_strategy
```

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs

-   **Market Data**: Market data relevant for risk assessment (e.g., price volatility, market indicators).
-   **Risk Parameters**: User-defined risk parameters and risk tolerance levels.
-   **Investment Strategy Configuration**: Configuration settings for the risk-based investment strategy to be implemented.

### Outputs

-   **Risk Assessments**:  Outputs from risk assessment models, quantifying market risk or portfolio risk.
-   **Investment Decisions**:  Investment decisions or adjustments based on risk assessments and strategy logic.
-   **Performance Metrics**: Metrics tracking the performance of the risk-based investment strategy.
-   **Logs**: Informational and error logs for monitoring agent activity and debugging.

## Workflow

1.  **Assess Risk**: The agent assesses market risk or portfolio risk using configured risk assessment models and data inputs (currently placeholder logic).
2.  **Analyze Risk Level**: The agent analyzes the assessed risk level against predefined risk parameters and tolerance levels (currently placeholder logic).
3.  **Adjust Investment Strategy**: Based on the risk assessment, the agent adjusts the investment strategy or portfolio allocation according to the RBI logic (currently placeholder logic).
4.  **Execute Trades**: The agent executes trades to implement the risk-adjusted investment strategy (currently placeholder logic).
5.  **Monitor Performance**: The agent monitors the performance of the risk-based investment strategy and tracks relevant metrics.
6.  **Log Activity**: The agent logs risk assessment activities, investment decisions, trade executions, and performance metrics for monitoring and analysis.

## Example Usage

To run the RBI Agent, you would instantiate and run the agent, configuring it with risk assessment models, risk parameters, and investment strategy settings. Since the current implementation is basic, the example usage primarily involves setting up the agent and potentially adding RBI logic.

```python
from src.agents.rbi_agent import RbiAgent

config = {
  "agent_id": "rbi_agent_01",
  "agent_type": "RbiAgent",
}

agent = RbiAgent(config)
# agent.run() # Run method currently placeholder
# Example of configuring a risk model and risk parameters (to be implemented)
# config["risk_model"] = "VolatilityModel"
# config["risk_parameters"] = {"volatility_threshold": 0.05}
# agent = RbiAgent(config)
# agent.start_rbi_strategy() # Method to initiate RBI strategy (to be implemented)
```

This example shows the basic instantiation of the RBI Agent. The `run` method is currently a placeholder and would need to be implemented with actual RBI logic. Future implementations would include methods to configure risk models, risk parameters, and initiate RBI strategies.

## Code Location

-   `src/agents/rbi_agent.py`

## Components

-   **`src/agents/base_agent.py` (BaseAgent)**: The RBI Agent inherits basic agent functionalities from the `BaseAgent`.
-   **Risk Assessment Components (To be implemented)**: Future implementations would include components for implementing various risk assessment models (e.g., volatility models, drawdown models).
-   **Investment Strategy Components (To be implemented)**: Components for implementing risk-based investment strategies and logic for adjusting portfolio allocation based on risk assessments.
-   **Data Analysis Components (Future)**: Components for analyzing market data and calculating risk metrics.

## Notes and Considerations

-   **Placeholder Implementation**: The current `RbiAgent` is a basic placeholder. Significant implementation is required to add actual RBI capabilities.
-   **Risk Model Selection**:  Selecting appropriate risk assessment models is crucial for the effectiveness of the RBI Agent. Consider different risk models and their suitability for cryptocurrency markets.
-   **Risk Parameter Tuning**:  Carefully tune risk parameters and risk tolerance levels to align with investment objectives and risk appetite.
-   **Strategy Backtesting**:  Thoroughly backtest risk-based investment strategies using historical data to evaluate their performance and optimize parameters before live deployment.
-   **Dynamic Risk Adjustment**:  Implement dynamic risk adjustment mechanisms that can adapt to changing market conditions and risk levels in real-time.
