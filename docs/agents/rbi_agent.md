# RBI Agent (`rbi_agent.py`)

## Purpose

The RBI (Risk-Based Investing) Agent is designed to enable users to implement sophisticated Risk-Based Investing (RBI) principles within their cryptocurrency portfolio management. This agent aims to provide a robust framework for dynamically adjusting asset allocation in response to predefined risk parameters and evolving market conditions, offering several key advantages:

*   **Automated Risk Management:**  Automates the complex process of risk management in cryptocurrency portfolios by continuously monitoring risk metrics and dynamically adjusting asset allocations to maintain a desired risk profile.
*   **Disciplined Risk-Based Allocation:**  Ensures a disciplined and systematic approach to asset allocation, preventing emotional decision-making and promoting adherence to predefined risk parameters and investment strategies.
*   **Volatility-Targeting and Risk Parity Strategies:**  Enables the implementation of advanced RBI strategies like Volatility Targeting and Risk Parity, which aim to optimize portfolio construction based on risk contribution and volatility levels rather than just asset returns.
*   **Enhanced Portfolio Diversification:**  Facilitates true portfolio diversification by allocating assets based on their risk characteristics and correlations, rather than simply diversifying across asset classes by capital allocation.
*   **Adaptability to Market Conditions:**  Allows for dynamic adjustments to portfolio allocations in response to changing market volatility, correlations, and risk levels, enhancing portfolio resilience and adaptability to different market regimes.

By implementing RBI principles, the RBI Agent strives to create more robust, risk-aware, and potentially more stable cryptocurrency portfolios compared to traditional market capitalization-weighted or return-focused allocation approaches.

## Functionality

The RBI Agent is envisioned to provide a comprehensive set of functionalities for implementing and managing Risk-Based Investing strategies:

*   **Flexible Risk Parameter Configuration:**
    - **Volatility Targets:**  Allow users to define target volatility levels for the overall portfolio or individual assets within the portfolio, enabling volatility-targeting strategies.
    - **Risk Tolerance Profiles:**  Enable users to select predefined risk tolerance profiles (e.g., conservative, moderate, aggressive) or customize their own risk tolerance parameters to align with their investment objectives.
    - **Maximum Drawdown Limits:**  Allow users to set maximum drawdown limits for the portfolio, triggering risk mitigation actions if portfolio losses exceed acceptable levels.
*   **Advanced Asset Risk Assessment and Modeling:**
    - **Volatility Measurement and Forecasting:**  Implement robust volatility measurement techniques (e.g., historical volatility, EWMA, GARCH models) to quantify asset risk and potentially forecast future volatility levels.
    - **Correlation and Co-variance Analysis:**  Incorporate correlation and co-variance analysis to assess the relationships between assets in the portfolio and understand portfolio-level risk diversification.
    - **Multi-Factor Risk Models:** (Future) Potentially integrate multi-factor risk models (e.g., Fama-French factors, macroeconomic factors) to capture systematic risk exposures and provide more comprehensive risk assessments.
*   **Dynamic and Automated Asset Allocation Strategies:**
    - **Risk Parity Allocation Algorithms:**  Implement Risk Parity algorithms to dynamically adjust asset allocations to achieve equal risk contributions from each asset in the portfolio, balancing risk exposure across holdings.
    - **Volatility Targeting Strategies:**  Incorporate Volatility Targeting strategies to dynamically adjust asset weights to maintain a predefined target portfolio volatility level, increasing or decreasing exposure based on market volatility fluctuations.
    - **Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) Optimization:** (Future) Explore advanced portfolio optimization techniques like CVaR optimization to minimize Conditional Value-at-Risk (a measure of tail risk) while achieving desired return targets and risk constraints.
*   **Comprehensive Performance Monitoring and Risk Reporting:**
    - **Real-time Portfolio Performance Tracking:**  Continuously monitor and track portfolio performance metrics, including total returns, annualized returns, and benchmark comparisons.
    - **Risk Metric Reporting:**  Generate detailed risk reports with key risk metrics such as portfolio volatility, Value-at-Risk (VaR), Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), and drawdown levels, providing users with a clear understanding of portfolio risk exposure.
    - **Performance Attribution Analysis:** (Future) Implement performance attribution analysis to identify the sources of portfolio returns and risk, attributing performance to asset allocation decisions, individual asset performance, and risk management strategies.

## AI Model(s) Used

Future, more advanced versions of the RBI Agent could incorporate AI models to enhance its risk management and portfolio optimization capabilities:

*   **Enhanced Risk Prediction and Forecasting:**
    - **Volatility Forecasting with Deep Learning:**  Utilize deep learning models (e.g., Recurrent Neural Networks like LSTMs, Transformer networks) to forecast future asset volatility and correlations more accurately, capturing non-linear dependencies and complex market dynamics for improved risk assessments.
    - **Risk Regime Prediction:**  Employ machine learning classifiers to predict shifts in market risk regimes (e.g., periods of high vs. low volatility, changing correlations), enabling proactive adjustments to RBI strategies based on anticipated risk regime changes.
*   **AI-Driven Optimal Portfolio Construction and Allocation:**
    - **Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Allocation:**  Use Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to dynamically optimize portfolio allocations for RBI strategies in real-time, learning optimal allocation policies based on market feedback, risk signals, and performance objectives.
    - **AI-Powered Portfolio Optimization Algorithms:**  Integrate AI-powered portfolio optimization algorithms that can handle complex, non-linear relationships between assets and risk factors, potentially outperforming traditional optimization methods in dynamic cryptocurrency markets.
*   **Personalized and Adaptive Risk Management:**
    - **User Risk Profiling with Machine Learning:**  Develop machine learning models to create personalized risk profiles for individual users based on their trading history, risk tolerance assessments, and investment preferences, tailoring RBI strategies to individual user needs.
    - **Adaptive Risk Parameter Adjustment:**  Implement AI-driven adaptive risk parameter adjustment mechanisms that automatically adjust RBI parameters (e.g., volatility targets, risk limits, allocation constraints) based on real-time market conditions, portfolio performance, and user risk profiles, ensuring dynamic and personalized risk management.

## Data Inputs

The RBI Agent requires the following data inputs to implement and manage Risk-Based Investing strategies:

*   **Cryptocurrency Market Data:**
    - **Price Data:** Historical and real-time price data for all assets included in the portfolio, used to calculate returns, volatility, correlations, and other risk metrics.
    - **Volume Data:** Trading volume data to assess asset liquidity and market activity, potentially used as a risk factor or for dynamic position sizing adjustments.
    - **Exchange API Data:** Data is typically sourced from cryptocurrency exchange APIs (e.g., Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) or data aggregators that provide comprehensive market data feeds.
*   **Risk-Free Rate Data (Optional):**
    - **Benchmark Risk-Free Rate:**  Data on a benchmark risk-free rate (e.g., yield on stablecoins or government bonds) used for calculating risk-adjusted performance metrics like Sharpe Ratio.
