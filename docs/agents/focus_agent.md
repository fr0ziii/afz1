# Focus Agent (`focus_agent.py`)

## Purpose

The Focus Agent is specifically designed to enhance user focus, minimize distractions, and maintain optimal context awareness during cryptocurrency trading activities. In today's fast-paced and information-rich trading environments, maintaining focus is crucial for making rational and effective decisions. The Focus Agent aims to address this need by:

*   **Reducing Distractions:** Filtering out irrelevant notifications, blocking distracting websites or applications, and minimizing environmental noise to create a more focused trading environment.
*   **Maintaining Context Awareness:** Providing timely and relevant contextual information, such as market summaries, trading goal reminders, and risk level updates, to keep users informed and aligned with their trading objectives.
*   **Improving Decision-Making:** By minimizing distractions and enhancing context, the Focus Agent aims to support more rational, less impulsive, and ultimately more profitable trading decisions.
*   **Enhancing Trading Discipline:**  Helping users adhere to their trading plans and strategies by reducing emotional trading and decision fatigue caused by information overload and distractions.
*   **Promoting Sustainable Trading Habits:**  Encouraging healthier and more sustainable trading habits by incorporating focus session management, break reminders, and performance tracking to prevent burnout and improve overall well-being.

The Focus Agent is not intended to provide trading signals or execute trades directly, but rather to act as a supportive tool that optimizes the user's trading environment and mental state for improved performance and focus.

## Functionality

The Focus Agent is intended to offer a range of functionalities to promote focused trading:

*   **Proactive Distraction Management:**
    - **Notification Filtering and Prioritization:**  Intelligently filter and prioritize notifications from trading platforms, news sources, social media, and other applications, allowing only critical alerts to reach the user during focused sessions.
    - **Website and Application Blocking:**  Temporarily block access to distracting websites (e.g., social media, news sites) and applications (e.g., social media apps, games) during focused trading periods, minimizing temptations to switch focus.
    - **Ambient Noise Control Integration:**  Integrate with ambient noise control applications or devices to automatically adjust noise levels in the user's environment, creating a more conducive atmosphere for concentration.
*   **Contextual Awareness and Information Delivery:**
    - **Periodic Market Summary Reminders:**  Deliver brief, periodic summaries of key market trends, price movements, and relevant economic events to maintain context without overwhelming the user with information.
    - **Trading Goal and Strategy Reminders:**  Provide timely reminders of the user's predefined trading goals, strategies, and risk parameters, reinforcing trading discipline and preventing deviations from planned approaches.
    - **Risk Level Monitoring and Alerts:**  Continuously monitor portfolio risk levels and trigger alerts when risk metrics exceed predefined thresholds, prompting users to reassess their positions and risk exposure.
*   **Focus Session Management and Habit Building:**
    - **Focus Session Timers and Progress Tracking:**  Implement focus session timers (e.g., Pomodoro timers) to structure trading sessions and track focused time, promoting time management and productivity.
    - **Break Reminders and Scheduling:**  Provide timely reminders to take regular breaks during extended trading sessions, preventing mental fatigue and maintaining focus over longer periods.
    - **Performance Analysis and Focus Score Tracking:**  Track trading performance metrics during focused sessions and potentially develop a "focus score" to measure and reward focused trading behavior, encouraging positive trading habits.

## AI Model(s) Used

Future implementations of the Focus Agent could leverage AI models to provide more advanced and personalized focus enhancement features:

*   **Distraction Detection and Classification:**
    - **Activity Monitoring Models:**  Utilize machine learning models to monitor user activity patterns (e.g., application usage, website visits, notification interactions) and detect potential distractions in real-time.
    - **Environmental Noise Analysis:**  Integrate with audio analysis models to detect and classify ambient noise levels in the user's environment, identifying potential auditory distractions.
*   **Personalized Focus Recommendations and Adaptive Strategies:**
    - **User Behavior Analysis:**  Employ AI models to analyze user trading behavior, focus patterns, and distraction triggers to create personalized focus profiles and recommendations.
    - **Adaptive Focus Techniques:**  Use machine learning to dynamically adjust focus enhancement techniques (e.g., notification filtering levels, website blocking intensity, break reminders) based on real-time user behavior and context.
*   **Context-Aware Information Prioritization and Filtering:**
    - **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Content Analysis:**  Integrate NLP models to analyze and understand the content of notifications, news feeds, and other information sources, prioritizing and filtering information based on relevance to the user's current trading context and goals.
    - **Sentiment and Urgency Analysis:**  Use sentiment analysis and urgency detection models to prioritize information that is critical, time-sensitive, or highly relevant to the user's trading decisions, minimizing information overload and focusing attention on key data points.
*   **Biofeedback Integration for Focus Monitoring:**
    - **Wearable Sensor Data Analysis:**  Integrate with wearable sensors (e.g., EEG, heart rate monitors) and AI models to analyze biofeedback data in real-time, providing objective measures of user focus and attention levels.
    - **Adaptive Focus Assistance:**  Use biofeedback data to dynamically adjust focus enhancement interventions, providing personalized and adaptive support based on the user's real-time focus state.

## Data Inputs

The Focus Agent can leverage various data inputs to personalize and optimize focus enhancement:

*   **User-Defined Trading Goals and Strategies:**
    - Explicitly defined trading goals (e.g., profit targets, risk limits) provided by the user.
    - User-selected trading strategies or preferred trading styles.
*   **Real-time Market Data and Agent Outputs:**
    - Market data feeds (price data, order book data, technical indicators) to provide contextual market information and updates.
    - Outputs from other agents (e.g., `ChartAnalysisAgent`, `SentimentAgent`, `RiskAgent`) to deliver relevant analysis results and alerts as contextual reminders.
*   **User Activity and Environment Data:**
    - **Application Usage Data:**  Data on applications used by the user, tracking potentially distracting applications (social media, browsers, games).
    - **Website Visit History:**  Logging website visits to identify distracting websites and browsing patterns.
    - **Notification Logs:**  Tracking notifications received by the user from various applications and sources.
    - **Environmental Sensor Data (Future):**  (Future) Integration with environmental sensors (e.g., noise level sensors, light sensors) to detect environmental factors that may impact focus.
    - **Biofeedback Data (Future):**  (Future) Data from wearable sensors (e.g., EEG, heart rate monitors) to directly measure user focus and attention levels in real-time.
*   **User Preferences and Customization Settings:**
    - User-defined preferences for focus techniques, notification filtering levels, website blocking lists, break reminders, and preferred contextual information types.
