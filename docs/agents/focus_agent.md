# Focus Agent

## Description

The Focus Agent is designed for maintaining focus and context during trading operations. It provides a basic framework for agents that can help users stay focused on their trading goals, manage distractions, and maintain context within the trading environment. This agent can be used to enhance user productivity and reduce errors by promoting a focused trading approach.

## Missions

[Description of the missions this agent is designed to accomplish. Link to mission files if applicable.]
- Currently, no specific mission files are defined for the Focus Agent. Missions would be defined based on the specific focus and context management tasks it is intended to handle.

## Configuration

The Focus Agent inherits basic configuration parameters from the `BaseAgent`. Specific configurations for focus management techniques, context tracking, and distraction management would be defined in the agent's configuration.

-   **agent_id**: A unique identifier for the agent instance.
-   **agent_type**: Must be set to `FocusAgent`.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
config:
  agent_id: focus_agent_01
  agent_type: FocusAgent
  # Add any focus specific configurations here in the future
  # e.g., focus_goals, distraction_sources, context_elements
```

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs

-   **User Goals**:  Trading goals and objectives that the agent should help the user focus on.
-   **Contextual Information**:  Relevant information and data points that help maintain trading context (e.g., market conditions, portfolio status).
-   **Distraction Events**:  Potential sources of distraction that the agent should help the user manage.

### Outputs

-   **Focus Reminders**:  Reminders and alerts to help the user stay focused on their trading goals.
-   **Contextual Updates**:  Updates and summaries of relevant contextual information.
-   **Distraction Management Actions**: Actions to minimize or manage distractions (e.g., muting notifications, blocking distracting websites).
-   **Logs**: Informational and error logs for monitoring agent activity and debugging.

## Workflow

1.  **Define Focus Goals**: The agent allows users to define their trading goals and objectives.
2.  **Monitor Context**: The agent monitors relevant contextual information to maintain trading context (currently placeholder logic).
3.  **Manage Distractions**: The agent helps users manage distractions by providing reminders or taking actions to minimize distractions (currently placeholder logic).
4.  **Provide Focus Reminders**: The agent provides timely reminders to help users stay focused on their goals.
5.  **Log Activity**: The agent logs focus management activities and user interactions for monitoring and analysis.

## Example Usage

To run the Focus Agent, you would instantiate and run the agent, configuring it with user goals and distraction management settings. Since the current implementation is basic, the example usage primarily involves setting up the agent and potentially adding focus management logic.

```python
from src.agents.focus_agent import FocusAgent

config = {
  "agent_id": "focus_agent_01",
  "agent_type": "FocusAgent",
}

agent = FocusAgent(config)
# agent.run() # Run method currently placeholder
# Example of setting focus goals (to be implemented)
# config["focus_goals"] = ["Stick to trading plan", "Avoid emotional trading"]
# agent = FocusAgent(config)
# agent.start_focus_session() # Method to initiate focus session (to be implemented)
```

This example shows the basic instantiation of the Focus Agent. The `run` method is currently a placeholder and would need to be implemented with actual focus management logic. Future implementations would include methods to configure focus goals and initiate focus sessions.

## Code Location

-   `src/agents/focus_agent.py`

## Components

-   **`src/agents/base_agent.py` (BaseAgent)**: The Focus Agent inherits basic agent functionalities from the `BaseAgent`.
-   **Focus Management Components (To be implemented)**: Future implementations would include components for goal tracking, distraction detection, and reminder systems.
-   **Context Monitoring Components (Future)**: Components to monitor and provide relevant contextual information to the user.
-   **User Interface Components (Future)**: Components for user interaction, goal definition, and receiving focus reminders.

## Notes and Considerations

-   **Placeholder Implementation**: The current `FocusAgent` is a basic placeholder. Significant implementation is required to add actual focus management capabilities.
-   **Focus Management Techniques**:  Implementing focus management techniques would involve defining strategies for goal setting, distraction reduction, and context maintenance.
-   **User Customization**:  Allow users to customize focus goals, distraction sources, and reminder preferences.
-   **Integration with Trading Environment**:  Integrate the Focus Agent with the trading environment to provide context-aware focus reminders and distraction management.
-   **User Feedback**:  Gather user feedback to continuously improve the effectiveness of the Focus Agent in enhancing focus and productivity.
