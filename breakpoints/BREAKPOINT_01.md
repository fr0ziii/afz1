# BREAKPOINT 01

This file is created as a breakpoint for architectural planning and documentation.

## Description

This breakpoint marks the initial architectural review and documentation phase of the afz1 project. The goal is to assess the current project structure, understand the key components and their interactions, and identify areas for improvement in terms of architecture, documentation, and development process. This breakpoint serves as a foundation for future development and enhancements.

## Decisions

1. **Adopt Memory Bank System:** Integrate a memory bank system to maintain project context, track decisions, and manage progress. This will improve collaboration and ensure knowledge retention across development iterations. (Decision to be further elaborated in decisionLog.md)

2. **Prioritize Documentation:** Recognize the need for improved documentation. Focus on documenting core components, agent architecture, and setup process. Create a documentation roadmap to guide this effort. (Documentation roadmap to be detailed in progress.md)

3. **Enhance Configuration Management:** Implement a centralized configuration management system to handle agent configurations, API keys, and other settings. This will improve flexibility and security. (Configuration management plan to be outlined in productContext.md)

## Action Items

1. **Initialize Memory Bank:** Set up the memory bank directory and core files (`activeContext.md`, `productContext.md`, `progress.md`, `decisionLog.md`). (Assigned to: Architect Mode)

2. **Document Core Components:** Document the purpose, functionality, and interfaces of key components like `BinanceDataProvider`, `TechnicalIndicatorCalculator`, `SignalGenerator`, and `PatternRecognizer`. (Assigned to: Architect Mode, Code Mode)

3. **Document Agent Architecture:** Create a high-level document describing the agent architecture, including the base agent class and the structure of specialized agents like `ChartAnalysisAgent` and `FundingAgent`. (Assigned to: Architect Mode)

4. **Create Documentation Roadmap:** Develop a roadmap outlining the documentation effort, including priorities, timelines, and responsibilities. (Assigned to: Architect Mode)

5. **Outline Configuration Management Plan:** Define a plan for implementing a centralized configuration management system, considering security, flexibility, and ease of use. (Assigned to: Architect Mode)
